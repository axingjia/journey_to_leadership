* Welcome to the study of groups and their dynamics. The theories, research findings, definitions, case studies, examples, and figures that fill this book's pages have just one purpose: to describe and explain all things related to people and their groups. **Why do we join groups? What holds a group together? Do our groups change over time? How do groups influence us and how do we inflluence them? When does a group become a team? Why do some groups get so little done? What causes conflict in and between groups?** What are groups, and what are their essential qualities? These are just a few of the questions asked, explored, and answered in Group dynamics.
* Understanding people--why they think, feel, and act the way they do--require understanding their groups. Human behavior is so foten group behavior that people must be studied in context--embedded in their families, friendship cliques, teams, organizations, and so on--rather than in isolation. Understanding the social world--its politics, institutions, cultures, and conflicts--also requires understanding the intersecting and continually interacting groups that form society. Understanding yourself--why you think, feel, and act the way you do in any given situation--also requires understanding groups. In groups you define and confirm your values and beliefs and take on or refine your identity. When you face uncertain situations, you gain reassuring information about your problems and security in companionship in groups. You are most who you are when you are with others in groups.
* Understanding groups is also eminently practical. Much of the world's work is done by groups and teams, so efficiency, achievement, and progress--success itself--depend on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of groups. Productivity in the workplace, problem-solving in the boardroom, learning in the classroom, and even therapeutic change--all depend on group-level processes. Groups, too, hold the key to solve such societal problems as racism, sexism, and international conflict. Any attempt to change society will succeed only if the groups within that society change.

# Chapter 1: Introduction to Group Dynamics

## CHAPER OVERVIEW
* Groups come in all shape and sizes and their purposes are many and varied, but their influence is universal. The tendency to join with others in groups is perhaps the single most important characteristic of humans, and the processes that unfold within these groups leave an indeliable imprint on their members and on society. Yet, groups remain something of a mystery: unstudied at best, misunderstood at worst. This investigation into the nature of groups begins by answering two fundamental questions: What is a group and what are group dynamics?

The Adventure Expedition: Group and Their Dynamics
* On May 10, 1996, just after midnight, the members of the Adventure Consultants Guide Expedition crawled from tends pitched high on Mt. Everest to begin the final leg of their journey to the top of the world. The group included ten clients who had paid hefty sum to join the expedition; guides who set the climbing lines, carried provisions, and helped climbers along the way; and Rob Hall, the team's leader. Hall was one of the most experienced high-altitude climbers in the world; he had scaled Everest four times before
