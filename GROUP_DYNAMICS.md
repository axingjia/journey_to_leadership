* Welcome to the study of groups and their dynamics. The theories, research findings, definitions, case studies, examples, and figures that fill this book's pages have just one purpose: to describe and explain all things related to people and their groups. **Why do we join groups? What holds a group together? Do our groups change over time? How do groups influence us and how do we inflluence them? When does a group become a team? Why do some groups get so little done? What causes conflict in and between groups?** What are groups, and what are their essential qualities? These are just a few of the questions asked, explored, and answered in Group dynamics.
* Understanding people--why they think, feel, and act the way they do--require understanding their groups. Human behavior is so foten group behavior that people must be studied in context--embedded in their families, friendship cliques, teams, organizations, and so on--rather than in isolation. Understanding the social world--its politics, institutions, cultures, and conflicts--also requires understanding the intersecting and continually interacting groups that form society. Understanding yourself--why you think, feel, and act the way you do in any given situation--also requires understanding groups. In groups you define and confirm your values and beliefs and take on or refine your identity. When you face uncertain situations, you gain reassuring information about your problems and security in companionship in groups. You are most who you are when you are with others in groups.
* Understanding groups is also eminently practical. Much of the world's work is done by groups and teams, so efficiency, achievement, and progress--success itself--depend on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of groups. Productivity in the workplace, problem-solving in the boardroom, learning in the classroom, and even therapeutic change--all depend on group-level processes. Groups, too, hold the key to solve such societal problems as racism, sexism, and international conflict. Any attempt to change society will succeed only if the groups within that society change.

# Chapter 1: Introduction to Group Dynamics

## CHAPER OVERVIEW
* Groups come in all shape and sizes and their purposes are many and varied, but their influence is universal. The tendency to join with others in groups is perhaps the single most important characteristic of humans, and the processes that unfold within these groups leave an indeliable imprint on their members and on society. Yet, groups remain something of a mystery: unstudied at best, misunderstood at worst. This investigation into the nature of groups begins by answering two fundamental questions: What is a group and what are group dynamics?

The Adventure Expedition: Group and Their Dynamics
* On May 10, 1996, just after midnight, the members of the Adventure Consultants Guide Expedition crawled from tends pitched high on Mt. Everest to begin the final leg of their journey to the top of the world. The group included ten clients who had paid hefty sum to join the expedition; guides who set the climbing lines, carried provisions, and helped climbers along the way; and Rob Hall, the team's leader. Hall was one of the most experienced high-altitude climbers in the world; he had scaled Everest four times before.
* The climb to the summit of Mr. Everest is a careful orchestrated undertaking. Teams begin the ascent in the middle of the night to

* Groups are always will be essential to huamn life. All cultures and eras we have lived, worked, thrived, and died in our families, tribes, communes, communities, and clans. Our ancestors protected themselves from dangers and disasters by joining together in groups. Early civilizations--the Aztecs, Persians, Greeks, and Romans--organized their societies by forming legions, assemblies, publics, legislatives, bodies, and trade associations. For time immemorial, people have gathered for civic and religious purposes, including worship, celebrations, and festivals.
* So why study these groups? The answer is not complicated: Groups hold the secret to the universe--the huamn universe, at any rate. the rare individual--the prisoner in solitary confinement, the recluse, the castaway--is isolated from all groups, but most of us belong to all manner of groups: from our small, close-knit groups such as families or very close friends to larger groups of associates and collegues at school or where we work, to the very large groups of people with whom we share an important quality that creates a psychological bond between us all. Given we spend our entire lives getting into, getting out of, and taking part in groups, it's best to not ignore them. Even better, it's better to understand them: to recognize their key features, to study the psychological and interpersonal processes that continually shape and reshape them, and to learn ways to help them function effectively.

## 1.1. WHAT ARE GROUPS?
* Fish swimming in synchronized unison are called a school. A gathering of kangaroos is a mob. A three-some of crows cawing from their perch on a telephone wire is a murder. A gam is a group of whales. A flock of larks in flight is an exaltation. But what is a collection of human beings called? A group.

What Groups Do You Belong To?
* Some may bemoan the growing alienation of individuals from the small social groups that once linked them securely to society-at-large, but the single man or woman who has no connection to other men and women is an extraordinary rare human being.
* Instruction: Most people belong to dozens of groups, but we can become so accustomed to them that their influence on us goes unnoticed. Before reading further, make a list (written or mental) of all the groups to which you belong.
* Interpretation: Did you include your family? The people you work or study with? How about your roommates, housemates, or classmates? All of the people you have friended on Facebook? How about people of your sex, race, and citizenship and those who share your political beliefs? Are African American men, Canadians, and Republicans groups? Are you in a romantic relationship? Did you include you and your partner on your list of groups? Some people lists are longer than others, but a list of 40 or more groups would not be unusual.

### 1.1a Defining Groups
* The Adventure Expedition was, in many respects, a unique collection of people facing an enormous challenge. Rob Hall, its leader, deliberately created the group by recruiting its 26 members; climbers, guides, cooks, medical staff, and so on. Its members were united in their pursuit of a shared goal, as is so often the case with groups, **but some of the members put their own personal needs above those of the group.** The members not only interacted with each other face-to-face in a physical space, but they also used technology to communicate with one another and with people who were not part of the team. But Adventure Expedition, although unique in many ways, was nonetheless a **group**: two or more individuals who are connected by and within social relationships.

* Two or More Individuals. Groups come in a staggering assortment of shapes and sizes, from dyads (two members) and triads (three members) to huge crowds, mobs, and assemblies. Sociologist John James was so intrigued by the variation in the size of groups that he took to the streets of Eugene and Portland, Oregon, to record the size of the 9,129 groups he encountered there. He defined a group to be two or more people in "face-to-face interaction as evidenced by the criteria of gesticulation, laugher, smiles, talk, play or work". He recorded pedestrians walking down the city streets, people shopping, children on playgrounds, public gatherings at sports events and festivals, patrons during the intermissions at plays and entering movie theaters, and various types of work crews and teams. Most of these groups were small, usually with only two or three members, but groups that had been deliberately created for some specific purpose, such as the leadership team of a company, tended to be larger. His findings, and the results of studies conducted in other settings (e.g., cafeterias, businesses), suggest that groups tend to "gravitate to the smallest size, two".

* Who Are Connected. Definitions of the word group are as varied as groups themselves, **but a commonality shared by many of these definitions is an emphasis on social relations that link members to one another.** Three persons working on math problems in separate rooms can hardly be considered a group; they are not connected to each other in any way. If, however, we create relationships between them--**for example, we let them send notes to each other or we pick one person to distribute the problems to the others--then these three individuals can be considered a rudimentary group.** Neither would we call people who share some superficial similarity, such as eye color, a favoriate football team, or birth date, group members for we expect them to be connected to each other in socially meaningful ways. A family is a group because the members are connected, not just by blood but also by social and emotional relationships. Adventure Expedition was a group because the members were linked by the tasks that they completed collectively and by friendships, alliances, responsibilities, and inevitable antagonisms.

* By and Within Social Relations. The relations that link the members of groups are not of one type. In families, for example, the relationships are based on kinship, but in the workplace, they are based on task-related interdependencies. In some groups, members are friends, but in others, the members are linked by common interests or experiences. Nor are the relationships linking members equally strong or enduring. Some relationships, like the links between members of a family or a clique of close friends, are tenacious, for they have developed over time and are based on a long history of mutual influence and exchange. In others, the ties between members may be so fragile that they are easily severed. Every individual member of the group does not need to be linked to every other person in the group. In the Adventure Expedition group, for example, some people were linked by all the other group members, but others had only a few friends in the group. In some cases, such as group based on ethnicity, race, or gender, the connection linking members may be more psychological than interpersonal. But no matter what the nature of the relations, a group exists when some type of bond links the members to one another and to the group itself.

What is a Group?
* No one definition can capture the many nuances of the word group. Some definers stress the importance of communication or mutual dependence. Still others suggest that a shared purpose or goal is what turns a mere aggregate of individuals into a bona fide group. Even the minimal number of members needed for a true group is debated, with some definitions requiring three members but others only two.

* Categorization: "Two or more individuals... who perceive themselves to be members of the same social category"

* Communication: "Three or more people... who think of themselves as a group, b) are interdependent (e.g., with regard to shared goals or behaviors that affect one another), and c) communicate (interact) with one another (via face-to-face or technological means)

* Influence: "Two or more persons who are interacting with one another in such a manner that each person influences and is influenced by each other person."

* Interdependence: "A dynamic whole based on interdependence rather than similarity".

* Interrelation: "An aggregation of two or more people who are to some degree in dynamic interrelation with one another.

* Psychological significance: "A psychological group is any number of people who interact with each other, are psychologically aware of each other, and perceive themselves to be in a group"

* Relations: "Individuals who stand in certain relations to each other, for example, as sharing a common purpose or having a common intentionality, or acting together, or at least having a common interest"

* Shared identity: "Two or more people possessing a common social identification and whose existence as a group is recognized by a third party"

* Shared tasks and goals: "Three or more people who work together interdependently or an agree-upon activity or goal.

* Size "Two or more people"

* Social unit: "Persons who recognize that they constitute a meaningful social unit, interact on that basis, and are committed to that social unity" 

* Structure: "A social unit which consists of a number of individuals who stand in (more or less) definite status and role relationship to one another and which possess a set of values or norms of its own regulating the behavior of individual members, at least in matters of consequence to the group"

* System: "An intact social system, complete with boundaries, interdependence for some shared purpose, and differentiated member roles"

### 1-1b Varieties of Groups
* No one knows for certain how many groups exist at this moment, but given the number of people on the planet and their groupist proclivities, 30 billion in a conservate estimate. Groups are so numerous that the differences among them are as noteworthy as their similarities. Figure 1.1 brings some order to this challenging miscellany by distinguishing between four types of groups: primary groups, social groups, collectives, and categories.

* Primary Groups. Sociologist Charles Horton Cooley labeled the small intimate clusters of close associates, such as families, good friends, or cliques of peers, primary groups. These groups profoundly influence the behavior, feelings, and judgment of their members, for members spend much of their time interacting with one another, usually in face-to-face settings with many of hte other members present. Even when the group is dispersed, members nonetheless feel they are still "in" the group, and they consider the group to be a very important part of their lives.
* In many cases, individuals become part of primary groups involuntarily: Every member of Adventure Expedition was born into a family that provided for their well-being until they could venture out to join other groups. Other primary groups form when people interact in significant, meaningful ways for a prolonged period of time. For example, and unlike Adventure Expedition, some climbing teams have summited so many mountains on so many expeditions that these groups are more like families than expeditions. They "continue, with more or less the same people in them, for a very long time", and affect the members' lives in significant and enduring ways.  They are broad rather than limited in their scope.
* Gooley considered such groups to be primary because they transform individuals into social beings. Primary groups protect members from harm, care for them when they are ill, and provide them with shelter and sustenance, but as Cooley explained, they also create the connection between the individual and society at large:

        They are primary in several senses, but chiefly in that they are fundamental in forming the social nature and ideals of the individual. The result of intimate association, psychologically, is a certain fusion of individualities in a common whole, so that one's very self, for many purposes at least, is the common life and purpose at least, is the cokmmon life and purpose of the group. Perpaps the simplest way of describing this wholeness is by saying that it is a "we"

* *Social (Secondary) Groups* In earlier eras, people lived most of their lives in primary groups that were clustered together in relatively small tribes or communities. But, as societies became more complex, so did our groups. We began to associate with a wider range of people in less intimate, more public settings, and **social groups** emerged to structure these interactions. Social groups are larger and more formally organized than primary groups, and memberships tend to be shorter in duration and less emotionally involving. Their boundaries are also more permeable, so members can leave old groups behind and join new ones, for they do not demand the level of commitment that primary groups do. People usually belong to a very small number of primary groups, but they can enjoy membership in a variety of social groups. Various terms have been used to describe this category of groups, such as *secondary groups*, *associations*, *task groups*, and *Gesellchaften*.
* Social groups, such as the Adventure Expedition, military squads, governing boards, construction workers, teams, crews, fraternaties, sororities, dance troupes, orchestras, bands, ensembles, classes, clubs, secretarial pools, congregations, study groups, guilds, task forces, committees, and meetings, are extremely common. When surveyed, 35.7% of American reported they belong to some type of religious group (e.g., congregation) and 20.0% said they belong to a sports team or club. The majority, ranging from 50% to 80% reported doing things in groups, such as attending a sports event together, visiting one another for the evening, sharing a meal together, or going out as a group to see a movie. People could dine, watch movies, and travel singly, but most do not: They prefer to perform these activities in social groups. Americans are above average in their involvement in voluntary associations, but some countries' citizens--the Dutch, Canadians, Scandinavians--are groupier still.

* **Collectives** Some groups come into existence when people are drawn together by something--an event, an activity, or even danger--but then the group dissolves when the experience ends. Any gathering of individuals can be considered a **collective**, but most theorists reserve the term for larger, less intricately interconnected associations among people. A list of examples of collectives would include crowds watching a building burn, audiences seated in a movie theater, line (queues) of people waiting to purchase tickets, gathering of college students protesting a government policy, and panicked mobs fleeing from danger. But the list would also include social movements of individuals who, though disperse over a wide area, display common shifts in opinion or actions. **The members of collectives are joined by their common interest or shared actions, but they often owe little allegiance to the group. In many cases, such groups are created by happenstance, convenience, or a short-lived expereience, and so the relations joining the members are so transitory that they dissolve as soon as the mmembers separate.

Are People Bowling Alone?
* The numbers tell the tale. In 1975, people reported playing card games together, like poker and bridge, about 14 times a year. By 2000, that number had been halved. In the 1970, 50% of the people surveyed agreed that their family usually eats dinner together. By the end of the century, only about 33% reported regaular family meals and the family vacation was also becoming rarer. Today fewer people report visiting with neighbors frequently and they are less likely to join social clubs, such as the Kiwanis and garden clubs. As the political scientist Robert Putnam

* **Categories** A **social category** is a collection of individuals who are similar to one another in some way. For example, citizens of Ireland are Irish, Americans whose ancestors were from Africa are African Americans, and men who are sexually attracted to other men are gay. If a category has no social implications, then it only describes individuals who share a feature in common. If, however, these categories set in motion personal or interpersonal processes--if someone celebrities St. Patrick's Day because of his Irish heritage, if people respond to a woman differently when they see she is an African American, or if a gay man identifies with other LGBTQ persons--then a category may be transformed into a highly influential group.
* As social psychologist Henri Tajfel explained, members of the same social category often share a common identity with one another. They know who is in their category, who is not, and what qualities are typical of insiders and outsiders. This perception of themselves as members of the same group of social category--this **social identity**--is "that part of an individual's self concept which derives from his knowledge of his membership of a social group (or groups) together
