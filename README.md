Leadership: Theory and Practice

# Introduction
* Leadership is a highly sought-after and highly valued commodity. In the 15 years since the first edition of this book was published, the public has become increasingly captivated by the idea of leadership. People continue to ask themselves and others what makes good leaders. As individuals, they seek more information on how to become effective leaders. As a result, bookstore shelves are filled with popular books about leaders and advice on how to be a leader. Many people believe that leadership is a way to improve their personal, social, and professional lives. Corporations seek those with leadership ability because they believe they bring special assets to their organizations and, ultimately, improve the bottom line. Academic institutions throughout the country have responded by providing programs in leadership studies.
* In addition, leadership has gained th attention of researchers worldwide. A review of the scholarly studies on leadership shows that there is a wide variety of different theoretical approaches to explain the complexities of the leadership process. Some researchers conceptualize leadership as a trait of as a behaviour, whereas others view leadership from an information-processing perspective or relational standpoint. Leadership has been studied using both qualitative and quantitative methods in many contexts, including small groups, therapeutic groups, and large organizations. Collectively, the research findings on leadership from all of these areas provide a picture of a process that is far more sophisticated and complex than the often simplistic view presented in some of the popular books on leadership.
* This book treats leadership as a complex process having multiple dimensions. Based on the research literature, the text provides an in-depth description and application of many different approaches to leadership. Our emphasis is on how theory can inform the practice of leadership. In this book, we describe each theory and then explain how the theory can be used in real situations.

## Leadership Defined
* There are many ways to finish the sentence, "Leadership is ..." In fact, as Stogdill pointed out in a review of leadership research, there are almost as many different definitions of leadership as there are people who have tried to define it. It is much like the words democracy, love, and peace. Although each of us intuitively knows what we mean by such words, the words can have different meanings for different people. As box 1.1 shows, scholars and practioners have attempted to define leadership for more than a century without universal consensus.

Box 1.1 The Evolution of Leadership Definitions

* While many have a gut-level grasp of what leadership is, putting a definition to the term has proved to be a challenging endeavor for scholars and practioners alike. More than a century has lapsed since leadership became a topic of academic introspection, and definitions have evolved continuously during that period. These defintions have been influenced by many factors from world affairs and politics to the perspectives of the discipline in which the topic is being studied. In a seminal work, Rost analyzed materials written from 1900 to 1990, finding more than 200 different definitions for leadership. His analysis provides a succinct history of how leadership has been defined through the last century:

1990-1929
* Definition of leadership appearing in the first three decades of the 20th century emphasized control and centralization of power with a common theme of domination. For example, at a conference on leadership in 1927, leadership was defined as "the ability to impress the will of the leader on those led and induce obedience, respect, loyalty, and cooperation".

1930s
* Traits became the focus of defining leadership, with an emerging view of leadership as influence rather tahn domination. Leadership is also identified as the interaction of an individual's specific personality traits with those of a group, noting that while the attitudes and activities of the many are changed by the one, the many may also influence a leader.

1940s
* The group approach came into the forefront with leadership being defined as the behaviour of an individual while involved in directing group activities. At the same time, leadership by persuasion is distinguished from "drivership" or leadership by coercion.

1950s
* Three themes dominated leadership definitions during this decade:

        * Continuance of group theory, which framed leadership as what leaders do in groups;
        * Leadership as a relationship that develops shared goals, which defined leadership based on behaviour of the leader, and 
        * effectiveness, in which leadership is defined by the ability to influence overall group effectiveness

1960s
* Although a tumultuous time for world affairs, the 1960s saw harmony among leadership scholars. The prevailing definition of leadership as behavior that influecnes people toward shared goals was underscored by Seeman who described leadership as "act by persons which influence other persons in a shared direction"

1970s
* The group focus gave way to the organizational behavior approach, where leadership became viewd as "initiating and maintaining groups or organizations to accomplish group or organizational goals". Burn's definition, however, is the most important concept of leadership to emerge: **"Leadership is the reciprocal process of mobilizing by persons with certain motives and values, various economic, political, and other resources, in a context of competition and conflict, in order to realize goals independentlu or mutually helf by both leaders and followers".**

1980s
* This decade exploded with scholarly and popular works on the nature of leadership, brining the topic to the apex of the academic and pulic consciousnesses. As a result, the number of definition for leadership beame a prolific stew with several persevering themes:

        * Do as the leader wishes. Leadership definitions still predominantly deliver the message that leadership is getting followers to do what the leader wants done.
        * Influence. Probably the most often used word in leadership definitions of the 1980s, influence is examined from every angle. In an effort to distinguish leadership from management, however, scholars insist that leadership is noncoercive influence.
        * Traits. Spurred by the national bestseller *In Search of Excellence*, the leadership-as-excellence movement brought leaders traits back to the spotlight. As a result, many people's understanding of leadership is based on a trait orientation.
        * Transformation. Burns is credited for initiating a movement defined leadership as a transformational process, stating that leadership occurs "when one or more persons engage with others in such a way that leadrs and followers raise one another to higher levels of motivation and morality".

Into the 21st Century
* After decades of dissonance, leadership scholars agree on one thing: They can't come up with a common definition for leadership. Debate continues as to whether leadership and management are separate processes, while others emphasize the trait, skill, or relational aspects of leadership. Because of such factors as growing global influences and generational differences, leadership will continue to have different meaning for different people. The bottom line is that leadership is a complex concept for which a determined definition may long be in flux.

## Ways of Conceptualizing Leadership
* In the past 60 years, as many as 65 percent classification systems have been developed to define the dimensions of leadership. One such classification system, directly related to our discussion, is the scheme proposed by Bass. He suggested that some definitions view leadership as the focus of group processes. From this perspective, the leader is at the center of group change and activity and embodies the will of the group. Another set of definitions conceptualizes leadership from a personality perspective, which suggests that leadership is a combination of special traits or characteristics that some individuals possess. These traits enable those individuals to induce others to accomplish tasks. Other approaches to leadership define it as **an act or a behaviour--the things leaders do to bring about change in a group.**
* In addition, some define leadership in terms of the power relationship that exists between leaders and followers. From this viewpoint, leaders have power that they wield to effect change in others. Others view leadership as a transformational process that moves followers to accomplish more than is usually expected of them. Finally, some scholars address leadership from a skill perspective. This viewpoint stresses the capabilities (knowledge and skills) that make effective leadership possible.

## Definition and Components
* Despite the multitude of ways in which leadership has been conceptualized, the following components can be identified as central to the phenomenon: a) Leadership is a process, b) leadership involves influence, 3) leadership occurs in groups, and d) leadership involves common goals. Based on these components, the following definition of leadership is used in this text:

        Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal.
    
* Defining leadership as a process means that it is not a trait or characteristics that resides in the leader, but rather a transactional event that occurs between the leader and the followers. Process implies that a leader affects and is affected by followers. It emphasizes that leadership is not a linear, one-way event, but rather an interactive event. When leadership is defined in this manner, it becomes available to everyone. It is not restricted to the formally designated leader in a group.
* Leadership involves influence. It is concerned with how the leader affects followers. Influence is the sine qua non of leadership. Without influence, leadership does not exist.
*  Leadership occurs in groups. Groups are the context in which leadership takes place. Leadership involves influencing a group of individuals who have acommon purpose. This can be a small task group, a community group, or a large group encompassing an entire organization. Leadership is about one individual influencing a group of others to accomplish common goals. Others (a group) are required for leadership to occur. Leadership training programs that teach people to lead themselves are not considered a part of leadership within the definition that is set forth in this discussion.
* Leadership includes attention to common goals. Leaders direct their energies toward individuals who are trying to achieve something together. By common, we mean that the leadrs and followers have a mutual purpose. Attention to common goals gives leadership an ethical overtone because it stresses the need for leaders to work with follows to achieve selected goals. Stressing mutuality lessens the possibility that leaders might act toward followers in ways that are forced or unethical. It also increases the possibility that leaders and followers will work together toward a common goal.
* Throughout this text, the people who engage in leadership will be called leaders, and those toward whom leadership is directed will be called followers. Both leaders and followers are involved together in the leadership process. Leaders need followers, and followers need leaders. Although leaders and followers are closely linked, it is the leader who often initiates the relationship, creates the communication linkages, and carries the burden for maintaining the relationship.
* In our discussion of leaders and followers, attention will be directed toward follower issues as well as leader issues. Leaders have an ethical responsibility to attend to the needs and concerns of followers. As Burns pointed out, discussions of leadership sometimes are viewed as elitist because of the implied power and importance often ascribed to leaders in the leader-follower relationship.
