Leadership: Theory and Practice

# Introduction
* Leadership is a highly sought-after and highly valued commodity. In the 15 years since the first edition of this book was published, the public has become increasingly captivated by the idea of leadership. People continue to ask themselves and others what makes good leaders. As individuals, they seek more information on how to become effective leaders. As a result, bookstore shelves are filled with popular books about leaders and advice on how to be a leader. Many people believe that leadership is a way to improve their personal, social, and professional lives. Corporations seek those with leadership ability because they believe they bring special assets to their organizations and, ultimately, improve the bottom line. Academic institutions throughout the country have responded by providing programs in leadership studies.
* In addition, leadership has gained th attention of researchers worldwide. A review of the scholarly studies on leadership shows that there is a wide variety of different theoretical approaches to explain the complexities of the leadership process. Some researchers conceptualize leadership as a trait of as a behaviour, whereas others view leadership from an information-processing perspective or relational standpoint. Leadership has been studied using both qualitative and quantitative methods in many contexts, including small groups, therapeutic groups, and large organizations. Collectively, the research findings on leadership from all of these areas provide a picture of a process that is far more sophisticated and complex than the often simplistic view presented in some of the popular books on leadership.
* This book treats leadership as a complex process having multiple dimensions. Based on the research literature, the text provides an in-depth description and application of many different approaches to leadership. Our emphasis is on how theory can inform the practice of leadership. In this book, we describe each theory and then explain how the theory can be used in real situations.

## Leadership Defined
* There are many ways to finish the sentence, "Leadership is ..." In fact, as Stogdill pointed out in a review of leadership research, there are almost as many different definitions of leadership as there are people who have tried to define it. It is much like the words democracy, love, and peace. Although each of us intuitively knows what we mean by such words, the words can have different meanings for different people. As box 1.1 shows, scholars and practioners have attempted to define leadership for more than a century without universal consensus.

```
Box 1.1 The Evolution of Leadership Definitions

* While many have a gut-level grasp of what leadership is, putting a definition to the term has proved to be a challenging endeavor for scholars and practioners alike. More than a century has lapsed since leadership became a topic of academic introspection, and definitions have evolved continuously during that period. These defintions have been influenced by many factors from world affairs and politics to the perspectives of the discipline in which the topic is being studied. In a seminal work, Rost analyzed materials written from 1900 to 1990, finding more than 200 different definitions for leadership. His analysis provides a succinct history of how leadership has been defined through the last century:

1990-1929
* Definition of leadership appearing in the first three decades of the 20th century emphasized control and centralization of power with a common theme of domination. For example, at a conference on leadership in 1927, leadership was defined as "the ability to impress the will of the leader on those led and induce obedience, respect, loyalty, and cooperation".

1930s
* Traits became the focus of defining leadership, with an emerging view of leadership as influence rather tahn domination. Leadership is also identified as the interaction of an individual's specific personality traits with those of a group, noting that while the attitudes and activities of the many are changed by the one, the many may also influence a leader.

1940s
* The group approach came into the forefront with leadership being defined as the behaviour of an individual while involved in directing group activities. At the same time, leadership by persuasion is distinguished from "drivership" or leadership by coercion.

1950s
* Three themes dominated leadership definitions during this decade:

        * Continuance of group theory, which framed leadership as what leaders do in groups;
        * Leadership as a relationship that develops shared goals, which defined leadership based on behaviour of the leader, and 
        * effectiveness, in which leadership is defined by the ability to influence overall group effectiveness

1960s
* Although a tumultuous time for world affairs, the 1960s saw harmony among leadership scholars. The prevailing definition of leadership as behavior that influecnes people toward shared goals was underscored by Seeman who described leadership as "act by persons which influence other persons in a shared direction"

1970s
* The group focus gave way to the organizational behavior approach, where leadership became viewd as "initiating and maintaining groups or organizations to accomplish group or organizational goals". Burn's definition, however, is the most important concept of leadership to emerge: **"Leadership is the reciprocal process of mobilizing by persons with certain motives and values, various economic, political, and other resources, in a context of competition and conflict, in order to realize goals independentlu or mutually helf by both leaders and followers".**

1980s
* This decade exploded with scholarly and popular works on the nature of leadership, brining the topic to the apex of the academic and pulic consciousnesses. As a result, the number of definition for leadership beame a prolific stew with several persevering themes:

        * Do as the leader wishes. Leadership definitions still predominantly deliver the message that leadership is getting followers to do what the leader wants done.
        * Influence. Probably the most often used word in leadership definitions of the 1980s, influence is examined from every angle. In an effort to distinguish leadership from management, however, scholars insist that leadership is noncoercive influence.
        * Traits. Spurred by the national bestseller *In Search of Excellence*, the leadership-as-excellence movement brought leaders traits back to the spotlight. As a result, many people's understanding of leadership is based on a trait orientation.
        * Transformation. Burns is credited for initiating a movement defined leadership as a transformational process, stating that leadership occurs "when one or more persons engage with others in such a way that leadrs and followers raise one another to higher levels of motivation and morality".

Into the 21st Century
* After decades of dissonance, leadership scholars agree on one thing: They can't come up with a common definition for leadership. Debate continues as to whether leadership and management are separate processes, while others emphasize the trait, skill, or relational aspects of leadership. Because of such factors as growing global influences and generational differences, leadership will continue to have different meaning for different people. The bottom line is that leadership is a complex concept for which a determined definition may long be in flux.
```

## Ways of Conceptualizing Leadership
* In the past 60 years, as many as 65 percent classification systems have been developed to define the dimensions of leadership. One such classification system, directly related to our discussion, is the scheme proposed by Bass. He suggested that some definitions view leadership as the focus of group processes. From this perspective, the leader is at the center of group change and activity and embodies the will of the group. Another set of definitions conceptualizes leadership from a personality perspective, which suggests that leadership is a combination of special traits or characteristics that some individuals possess. These traits enable those individuals to induce others to accomplish tasks. Other approaches to leadership define it as **an act or a behaviour--the things leaders do to bring about change in a group.**
* In addition, some define leadership in terms of the power relationship that exists between leaders and followers. From this viewpoint, leaders have power that they wield to effect change in others. Others view leadership as a transformational process that moves followers to accomplish more than is usually expected of them. Finally, some scholars address leadership from a skill perspective. This viewpoint stresses the capabilities (knowledge and skills) that make effective leadership possible.

## Definition and Components
* Despite the multitude of ways in which leadership has been conceptualized, the following components can be identified as central to the phenomenon: a) Leadership is a process, b) leadership involves influence, 3) leadership occurs in groups, and d) leadership involves common goals. Based on these components, the following definition of leadership is used in this text:

        Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal.
    
* Defining leadership as a process means that it is not a trait or characteristics that resides in the leader, but rather a transactional event that occurs between the leader and the followers. Process implies that a leader affects and is affected by followers. It emphasizes that leadership is not a linear, one-way event, but rather an interactive event. When leadership is defined in this manner, it becomes available to everyone. It is not restricted to the formally designated leader in a group.
* Leadership involves influence. It is concerned with how the leader affects followers. Influence is the sine qua non of leadership. Without influence, leadership does not exist.
*  Leadership occurs in groups. Groups are the context in which leadership takes place. Leadership involves influencing a group of individuals who have acommon purpose. This can be a small task group, a community group, or a large group encompassing an entire organization. Leadership is about one individual influencing a group of others to accomplish common goals. Others (a group) are required for leadership to occur. Leadership training programs that teach people to lead themselves are not considered a part of leadership within the definition that is set forth in this discussion.
* Leadership includes attention to common goals. Leaders direct their energies toward individuals who are trying to achieve something together. By common, we mean that the leadrs and followers have a mutual purpose. Attention to common goals gives leadership an ethical overtone because it stresses the need for leaders to work with follows to achieve selected goals. Stressing mutuality lessens the possibility that leaders might act toward followers in ways that are forced or unethical. It also increases the possibility that leaders and followers will work together toward a common goal.
* Throughout this text, the people who engage in leadership will be called leaders, and those toward whom leadership is directed will be called followers. Both leaders and followers are involved together in the leadership process. Leaders need followers, and followers need leaders. Although leaders and followers are closely linked, it is the leader who often initiates the relationship, creates the communication linkages, and carries the burden for maintaining the relationship.
* In our discussion of leaders and followers, attention will be directed toward follower issues as well as leader issues. Leaders have an ethical responsibility to attend to the needs and concerns of followers. As Burns pointed out, discussions of leadership sometimes are viewed as elitist because of the implied power and importance often ascribed to leaders in the leader-follower relationship. Leaders are not above or better than followers. Leaders and followers must be understood in relation to each other, and collectively. They are in the leadership relationship together--and are two sides of the same coin.

## LEADERSHIP DESCRIBED
* In addition to definitional issues, it is also important to discuss several other questions pertaining to the nature of leadership. In the following section, we will address questions such as how leadership as a trait differs from leadership as a process; how appointed leadership differs from emergent leadership; and how the concepts of power, coercion, and management differ from leadership.

### Trait Versus Process Leadership
* We have all heard statements such as "He is born to be a leader" or "She is a natural leader". These statements are commonly expressed by people who take a trait perspective toward leadership. The trait persepctive suggest that certain individuals have special innate or inborn characteristics or qualities that make them leaders, and that it is these qualities that differentiate them from nonleaders. Some of the personal qualities used to identify leaders include unique physical factors (e.g., height), personality features (e.g., extraversion), and other characteristics (e.g., intelligence and fluency). In chapter 2, we will discuss a large body of research that has examined these personal qualities.
* To describe leadership as a trait is quite different from describing it as a process. The trait viewpoint conceptualizes leadership as a properties possessed in varying degrees by different people. This suggests that it resides in select people and restricts leadership to those who are believed to have special, usually inborn, talents.
* The process viewpoint suggests that leadership is a phenomenon that resides in the context of the interactions between leaders and followers and makes leadership available to everyone. As a process, leadership can be observed in leadership behaviours, and can be learned. The process definition of leadership is consistent with the definition of leadership that we have set forth in this chapter.

### Assigned Versus Emergent Leadership
* Some people are leaders because of their formal position in an organization, whereas others are leaders because of the way other group members respond to them. These two common forms of leadership are called assigned leadership and emergent leadership. Leadership that is based on occupying a position in an organization is assigned leadership. Team leaders, plant managers, department heads, directors, and administrators are all examples of assigned leadership.
* Yet this person assigned to a leadership position does not always become the real leader in a particular setting. When others perceive an individual as the most influential member of a group or an organization, regardless of the individual's title, the person is exhibiting emergent leadership. The individual acquires emergent leadership through other people in the organization who support and accept that individual's behavior. This type of leadership is not assigned by position; rather, it emerges over a period through communication. Someo of the positive communication behaviors that account for successful leader emergence include being verbally involved, being informed, seeking others' opinions, initiating new ideas, and being firm but not rigid.
* In addition to communication behaviors, researchers have found that personality plays a role in leadership emergence. For example, Smith and Foti found that certain personality traits were related to leadership emergence in a sample of 160 male college students. The individuals who were more dominant, more intelligent, and more confident about their own performance (general self-efficacy) were more likely to be identified as leaders by other members of their task group. Although it is uncertain whether these findings apply to women as well, Smith and Foti suggested that these three traits could be used to identify individuals perceived to be emergent leaders.
* Leadership emergence may also be affected by gender-biased perceptions. In a study of 40 mixed-six college groups, Watson and Hoffman found that women who were urged to persuade their task groups to adopt high-quality decisions succeeded with the same frequency as men with identical instructions. Although women were equally influential leaders in their groups, they were rated significantly lower than comparable men were on leadership. Furthermore, these influential women were also rated as significantly less likable than comparably influential men were. These results suggest that there continue to be barriers to women's emergence as leaders in some settings.
* A unique perspective on leadership emergence is provided by social identity theory. From this perspective, leadership emergence is **the degree to which a person fits with the identity of the group as a whole. As groups develop over time, a group prototype also develops. Individuals emerge as leaders in the group when they become most like the group prototype. Being similar to the prototype makes leaders attractive to the group and gives them influence with the group.**
* The leadership approaches we discuss in the subsequent chapters of this book apply equally to assigned leadership and emergent leadership. When a person is engaged in leadership, that person is a leader, whether leadership was assigned or emerged. This book focuses on the leadership process that occurs when any individual is engaged in influencing other group members in their efforts to reach a common goal.

### Leadership and Power
* The concept of power is related to leadership because it is part of the influence process. Power is the capacity or potential to influence. **People have power when they have the ability to affect others' beliefs, attitudes, and courses of action.** Ministers, doctors, coaches, and teachers are all examples of people who have the potential to influence us. When they do, they are using their power, the resource they draw on to effect changein us.
* The most widely cited research on power is French and Raven's work on the bases of social power. In their work, they conceptualized power from the framework of a dyadic relationship that included both the person influencing and the person being influenced. French and Raven identified five common and important bases of power: referent, expert, legitimate, reward, and coercive. Each of these bases of power increases a leader's capacity to influence the attitudes, values, or behaviors of others.

```
Table 1.1: Five Bases of Power

* Referent Power: Based on followers' identification and liking for the leader. A teacher who is adored by students has referent power.
* Expert Power: Based on followers' perceptions of the leader's competence. A tour guide who is knowledgeable about a foreign country has expert power.
* Legitimate Power: Associated with having status or formal job authority. A judge who administers sentences in the courtroom exhibits legitimate power.
* Reward Power: Derived from having the capacity to provide reward to others. A supervisor who gives rewards to employees who work hard is using reward power.
* Coercive Power: Derived from having the capacity to penalize or punish others. A coach who sits players on the bench for being late to practice is using coercive power.
```

* In organizations, there are two major kinds of power: position power and personal power. Position power is the power a person derives from a particular office or rank in a formal organizational system. It is the influence capacity a leader derives from having higher status than the followers have. Vice presidents and department heads have more power than staff personnel do becaues of the positions they hold in the organization. Position power include legitimat,  reward, and coercive power.
* Personal power is the influence capacity a leader derives from being seen by followers as likable and knowledgeable. When leaders act in ways that are important to followers, it gives leader power. For example, some managers have power because their subordinates consider them to be good role models. Others have power because their subordinates view them as highly competent or considerate. In both cases, these managers' power is ascribed to them by others, based on how they are seen in their relationships with others. Personal power includes referent and expert power.
* In discussions of leadership, it is not unusual for leaders to be described as wielders of power, as individuals who dominate others. In these instances, power is conceptualized as a tool that leaders use to achieve their own ends. Contrary to this view of power, Burns emphasized power from a relationship standpoint. For Burns, power is not an entity that leaders use over others to achieve their own ends; instead, power occurs in relationships. It should be used by leaders and followers to promote their collective goals.
* In this text, our discussions of leadership treat power as a relational concern for both leaders and followers. We pay attention to how leaders work with followers to reach common goals.

### Leadership and Coercion.
* Coercive power is one of the specific kinds of power available to leaders. Coercion involves the use of force to effect change. To coerce means to influence others to do something against their will and may include manipulating penalities and rewards in their work environment. Coercion often involves the use of threats, punishment, and negative reward schedules. Classic examples of coercive leaders are Adolf Hitler in Germany, the Taliban leaders in Afghanistan, Jim Jones in Guyana, and North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il, each of whom has used power and restraint to force followers to engage in extreme behaviours.
* It it important to distinuish between coercion and leadership because it allows us to separate out from our examples of leadership that behaivours of individuals such as Hitler, the Taliban, and Jones. In our discussions of leadership, coercive people are not used as models of ideal leadership. Our definition suggests that leadership is reserved for those who influence a group of individuals toward a common goal. Leaders who use coercion are interested in their own goals and seldom are interested in the wants and needs of subordinates. using coercion runs counter to working with followers to achieve a common goal.

### Leadership and Management
* Leadership is a process that is similar to management in many ways. Leadership involves influence, as does management. Leadership entails working with people, which management entails as well. Leadership is concerned with effective goal accomplishment, and so is management. In general, many of the functions of management are activities that are consistent with the definition of leadership we set forth at the beginning of this chapter.
* But leadership is also different from management. Whereas the study of leadership can be traced back to Aristotle, management emerged around the turn of the 20th century with the advert of our industrialized society. Management was created as a way to reduce chaos in organizations, to make them run more effectively and efficiently. The primary functions of management, as first identified by Fayol, were planning, organizing, staffing, and controlling. These funcctions are still representative of the field of management today.
* in a book that compared the function of management with the functions of leadership, Kotter argued that the functions of the two are quite dissimilar. **The overriding function of management is to provide order and consistency to organizations, whereas the primary function of leadership is to produce change and movement.** Management is about seeking order and stability, leadership is about seeking adaptive and constructive change.

```
        Management: Produce Order and Consistency
        * Planning and Budgeting: 
            * Establish agendas
            * Set timetables
            * Allocate resources
        * Organizing and Staffing
            * Provide structure
            * Make job placements
            * Establish rules and procedures
        * Controlling and Problem Solving
            * Develop incentives
            * Generate creative solutions
            * Take corrective action

        Leadership: Produces Change and Movement
        * Establish Direction
            * Create a vision
            * Clarify big picture
            * Set strategies
        * Align People
            * Communicate goals
            * Seek commitment
            * Build teams and coalitions
        * Motivating and Inspiring
            * Inspire and energize
            * Empower subordinates
            * Satisfy unmet needs
```

* As illustrated in Figure 1.2, the major activities of management are played out differently than the activities of leadership. Although they are different in scope, Kotter contended that both management and leadership are essential if an organization is to prosper. For example, if an organization has strong management without leadership, the outcome can be stifling and bureaucratic. Conversely, if an organizationhas strong leadership without management, the outcome can be meaningless or misdirected change for change's sake. To be effective, organizations need to nourish both competent management and skilled leadership.
* Many scholars, in addition to kotter, argue that leadership and management are distinct constructs. For example, Bennis and Nanus maintained that there is a significant difference between the two. **To manage means to accomplish activities and master routines, whereas to lead means to influence othersd and create visions for change.** Bennis and Nanus made the distinction very clear in their frequent quoted sentence, "Managers are people who do things right and leaders are people who do the right thing."
* Rost has also been a proponent of distinguishing between leadership and management. **He contended that leadership is a multidirectional influence relationship and management is a unidirectional authority relationship. Whereas leadership is concerned with the process of developing mutual purposes, management is directed toward coordinating activities in order to get a job done. Leaders and followers work together to create real change, whereas managers and subordinates join forces to sell goods and services.**
* Approaching the issue from a narrower viewpoint, Zaleznik went so far as to argue that leaders and managers themselves are distinct, and that they are basically different types of people. **He contended that managers are reactive and prefer to work with people to solve problem but do so with low emotional involvement. They act to limit choices. Zaleznik suggested that leaders, on the other hand, are emotional active and involved. They seek to shape ideas instead of responding to them and act to expand the available options to solve long-standing problems. Leaders change the way people think about what is possible.**
* Although there are clear differences between management and leadership, the two constructs overlap. When managers are involved in influencing a group to meet its goals, they are involved in leadership. When leaders are involved in planning, organizing, staffing, and controlling, they are involved in management. Both processes involve influencing a group of individuals toward goal attainment. For purposes of our discussion in this book, we focus on the leadership process. In our examples and case studies, we treat the roles of managers and leaders similarly and do not emphasize the differences between them.

## PLAN OF THE BOOK
* This book is user-friendly. It is based on substantive theories but is written to emphasize practice and application. Each chapter in the book follows the same format. The first section of each chapter briefly describes the leadership approach and discuss various research studies applicable to the approach. The second section of each chapter evaluates the approach, highlighting its strengths and criticisms. Special attention is given to how the approach contributes or fails to contribute to an overall understanding of the leadership process. The next section uses case studies to prompt discussion of how the approach can be applied in ongoing organizations. Finally, each chapter provides a leadership questionnaire along with a discussion of how the questionnaire measures the reader's leadership style. Each chapter ends with a summary and references.

# Chapter 2: Trait Approach

## DESCRIPTION
* Of interest to scholars throughout the 20th century, the trait approach was one of the first systematic attempts to study leadership. In the early 20th century, leadership traits were studied to determine what made certain people great leaders. The theories that were developed wwhat made certain people great leaders. The theories that were developed were called "great man" theories because they focused on identifying the innate qualities and characteristics possessed by great social, political, and military leaders. It was believed that people were born with these traits, and that only the "great" people possessed them. During this time, research concentrated on determining the specific traits that clearly differentiated leaders from followers.
* In the mid-20th century, the trait approach was challenged by research that questioned the universality of leadership traits. In a major review, Stogdill suggested that no consistent set of traits differentiated leaders from nonleaders across a variety of situations. An individual with leadership traits who was a leader in one situation might not be a leader in another situation. Rather than being a quality that individuals possess, **leadership was reconceptualized as a relationship between people in a social situation.** Personal factors related to leadership continued to be important, but researchers contended that these factors were to be considered as relative to the requirements of the situation.
* The trait approach has generated much interest among researchers for its explanation of how traits influence leadership. For example, an analysis of much of the previous trait research by Lord, DeVader, and Alliger found that personality traits were strongly associated with individual's perceptions of leadership. Similarly, Kirkpatrick and Locke went so far as to claim that effective leaders are actually distinct types of people in several key respects.
* The trait approach  has earned new interest through the current emphasis given by many researchers to visionary and charismatic leadership. Charismatic leadership catapulted to the forefront of public attention with 2008 election of the United States' first African American president, Barack Obama, who is charismatic, among many other attributes. In a study to determine what distinguishes charismatic leaders from others. Jung and Sosik found that charismatic leaders consistently possess traits of self-monitoring, engagement in impression management, motivation to attain social power, and motivation to attain self-actualization. In short, the trait approach is alive and well. It began with an emphasis on identifying the qualities of great persons, shifted to include the impact of situations on leadership, currently, has shifted back to reemphasize the critical role of traits in effective leadership.
* Although the research on traits spanned the entire 20th century, a good overview of this approach is found in two surveys completed by Stogdill. In his first survey, Stogdill analyzed and synthesized more than 124 trait studies conducted between 1904 and 1947. In his second study, he analyzed another 163 studies completed between 1948 and 1970. By taking a closer look at each of these reviews, we can obtain a clearer picture of how individuals' traits contribute to the leadership process.
* Stogdill's first survey identified a group of important leadership traits that were related to how individuals in various groups became leaders. His results showed that the average individual in the leadership role is different from an average group member with regard to the following eight traits: **intelligence, alertness, insight, responsibility, initiative, persistence, self-confidence, and sociability.**
* The findings of Stogdill's first survey also indicated that an individual does not become a leader solely because that individual possesses certain traits. Rather, the traits that leaders possess must be relevant to situations in which the leader is functioning. As stated earlier, leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in another situation. Findings showed that leadership was not a passive state but resulted from a working relationship between the leader and other group members. This research marked the beginning of a new approach to leadership research that focused on leadership behaviors and leadership situations.
* Stogdill's second survey, published in 1974, analyzed 163 new studies and compared the findings of these studies to the findings he had reported in his first survey. The second survey was more balanced in its description of the role of traits and leadership. Whereas the first survey implied that leadership is determined principally by situational factors and not personality, the second survey argued moderately that both personality and situational factors were determinants of leadership. In essence, the second survey validated the original trait idea that a leader's characteristics are indeed a part of leadership.
* Similar to the first survey, Stogdill's second survey also identified traits that were positive associated with leadership. The list included the following 10 characteristics:

```
1. Drive for responsibility and task completion;
2. vigor and persistence in pursuit of goals;
3. risk taking and originality in problem solving;
4. drive to exercise initiative in social situations;
5. self-confidence and sense of personal identity;
6. willingness to accept consequences of decision and action;
7. readiness to absorb interpersonal stress;
8. willingness to tolerate frustration and delay;
9. ability to influence other people's behaviour; and
10. capacity to structure social interaction systems to the purpose at hand.
```

* Mann conducted a similar study that examined more than 1,400 findings regarding personality and leadership in small groups, but he placed less emphasis on how situational factors influenced leadership. Although tentative in his conclusions, Mann suggested that personality traits could be used to distinguish leaders from nonleaders. His results identified leaders as strong in the following six traits: **intelligence, masculinity, adjustment, dominance, extraversion, and conversvatism.**
* Lord et al. reassessed Mann's findings using a more sophsiticated procedure called meta-analysis. Lord et al. found that intelligence, masculinity, and dominance were significantly related to how individuals perceived leaders. From their findings, the authors argued strongly that personality traits could be used to make discriminations consistently across situations between leaders and nonleaders.
* Both of these studies were conducted during periods in American history where male leadership was pervalent in most aspects of business and society. In Chapter 14, we explore more contemporary research regarding the role of gender in leadership, and we look at whether traits such as masculinity and dominance still bear out as important factors in distinguishing between leaders and nonleaders.
* Yet another review argues for the importance of leadership traits: Kirkpatrick and Locke contended that "it is unequivocally clear that leaders are not like other people". From a qualitative synthesis of earlier research, Kirkpatrick and Locke postulated that leaders differ from nonleaders on six traits: drive, motivation, integrity, confidence, cognitive ability, and task knowledge. According to these writers, individuals can be born with these traits, they can learn them, or both. It is these six traits that make up the "right stuff" for leaders. Kirkpatrick and Locke contended that leadership traits make some people different from others, and this difference should be recognized as an important part of the leadership process.
* In the 1990s, researchers began to investigate the leadership traits associated with "social intelligence", characterized as those abilities to understand one's own and others' feelings, behaviours, and thoughts and to act appropriately. Zaccaro defined social intelligence as having such capacities as social awareness, social acumen, self-monitoring, and the ability to select and enact the best response given the contingencies of the situation and social environment. A number of empirical studies showed these capacities to be a key trait for effective leaders. Zaccaro, Kemp, and Bader included such social abilities in the categories of leadership traits they outlined as important leadership attributes.
* Table 2.1 provides a summary of the traits and characteristics that were identified by researchers from the trait approach. It illustrates clearly the breadth of traits related to leadership. Table 2.1 also shows how difficult it is to select certain traits as definitive leadership traits; some of the traits appear in several of the survey studies, whereas others appear in only one or two studies. Regardless of the lack of precision in Table 2.1, however, it represents a general convergence of research regarding which traits are leadership traits.
* What, then, can be said about trait approach? What has a century of research on the trait approach given us that is useful? The answer is an extended list of traits that individual might hope to possess or wish to cultivate if they want to be perceived by others as leaders. Some of the traits that are central to this list include intelligence, self-confidence, determination, integrity, and sociality.

### Intelligence
* intelligence or intellectual ability is positively related to leadership. Based on their analysis of a series of recent studies on intelligence and various indices of leadership. Zaccaro et al. found support for the finding that leaders tend to have higher intelligence than nonleaders. Having strong verbal ability, perceptual ability, and reasoning appears to make one a better leader. Although it is good to be bright, the research also indicates that a leader's intellectual ability should not differ too much from that of the subordinates. If the leader's IQ is very different from that of the followers, it can have a counterproductive impact on leadership. Leaders with higher abilities may have difficulty communicating with followers because they are preoccupied or because their ideas are too advanced for their followers to accept.
* An example of a leader for whom intelligence was a key trait was Steve Jobs, founder and CEO of Apple Computers. Jobs once said, "I have this really incredible product inside me and I have to git it out". Those visionary products, first the Apple II and Macintosh computers and then iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, have revolutionized the personal computer and electronic device industry, changing the way people play and work.
* In the next chapter of this text, which addresses leadership from a skills perspective, intelligence is identified as a trait that significantly contributes to a leader's acquisition of complex problem-solving skills and social judgment skills. Intelligence is described as having a positive impact on an individual's capacity for effective leadership.

### Self-Confidence
* Self-confidence is another trait that helps one to be a leader. Self-confidence is the ability to be certain about one's competencies and skills. It includes a sense of self-esteem and self-assurance and the belief that one can make a difference. Leadership involves influencing others, and self-confidence allows the leader to feel assured that his or her attempts to influence others are appropriate and right.
* Again, Steve Jobs is a good example of a self-confident leader. When Jobs described the devices he want to create, many people said they weren't possible. But Jobs never doubted his products would change the world, and, despite resistance, he did things the way he thought best. "Jobs was one of those CEOs who ran the company like he wanted to. He believed he knew more about it than anyone else, and he probably did", said a colleague.

### Determination
* Many leaders also exhibit determination. Determination is the desire to get the job done and includes characteristics such as initiative, persistence, dominance, and drive. People with determination are willing to assert themselves, are proactive, and have the capacity to persevere in the face of obstacles. Being determined includes showing dominance at times and in situations where followers need to be directed.
* Lance Armstrong has shown determination in a number of ways. The seven0tie Tour de France champion has shown his determination as a cyclist, but also in his efforts to battle cancer. A cancer survivor, Armstrong founded the Livestrong organization, an organization that champions cancer awareness and support for survivors. His aim is "to guide people through the cancer experience, bring them together to fight cancer--and work for a world in which our fight is no longer necessary"

### Integrity
* Integrity is another of the important leadership traits. Integrity is the quality of honesty and trustworthiness. People who adhere to a strong set of principles and take responsibility for their actions are exhibiting integrity. Leaders with integrity inspire confidence in others because they can be trusted to do what they say they are going to do. They are loyal, dependable, and not deceptive. Basically, integrity makes a leader believable and worthy of our trust.
* In our society, integrity has received a great deal of attention in recent years. For example, as a result of two situations--the position taken by President George W. Bush regarding Iraq's alledged weapons of mass destruction nad the impeachment proceedings during the Clinton presidency--people are demanding more honesty of their public officials. Similarly, scandals in the corporate world (e.g., Enron and WorldCom), have led people to become skeptical of leaders who are not highly ethical. In the educational arena, new K-12 curricula are being developed to teach character, values, and ethical leadership (For instance, see the Character Counts! program developed by the Josephson Institute of Ethics in California at http://wwww.charactercount.org and the Pillars of Leadership program taught at the J. W. Fanning Institute for leadership in Georgia at http://www.fanning.uga.edu). In short,society is demanding greater integrity of character in its leaders.

### Sociability
* A final trait that is important for leaders is sociability. Sociability is a leader's inclination to seek out pleasant social relationships. Leaders who show sociability are friendly, outgoing, courteous, tactful, and displomatic. They are sensitive to others' needs and show concern for their well-being. Social leaders have good interpersonal skills and create cooperative relationships with their followers.
* An example of a leader with great sociability skills is Michael Hughes, a university president. Huges prefers to walk to all his meetings because it gets him out on campus where he greets students, staff, and faculty. He has lunch in the dorm cafeterias or student union and will often ask a table of strangers if he can sit with them. Students rate him as very approachable, while faculty say he has an open-door policy. In addition, he takes time to write personal notes to faculty, staff, and students to congratulate them on their successes.
* Although our discussion of leadership traits has focused on five major traits (i.e., intelligence, self-confidence, determination, integrity, and sociability), this list is not all-inclusive. While other traits indicated in Table 2.1 are associated with effective leadership, the five traits we have identified contribute substantially to one's capacity to be a leader.
* Until recently, most reviews of leadership traits have been qualitative. In addition, they have lacked a common organizing framework. However, the research described in the following section provides a quantitative assessment of leadership traits that is conceptually framed around the five-factor model of personality. It describes how five major personality traits are related to leadership.

### Five-Factor Personality Model and Leadership
* Over the past 25 years, a consensus has emerged among researchers regarding the basic factors that make up what we call personality. These factors, commonly called the Big Five, are neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.
* To assess the links between the Big Five and leadership, Judge, Bono, Ilies, and Gerhardt conducted a major meta-analysis of 78 leadership and personality studies published between 1967 and 1998. In general, Judge et al. found a strong relationship between the Big Five traits and leadership. It appears that having certain personality traits is associated with being an effective leader.
* Specifically, in their study, extraversion was the factor most strongly associated with leadership. It is the most important trait of effective leaders. Extraversion was followed, in order, by conscientiousness, openness, and low neuroticism. The last factor, agreeableness, was found to be only weakly associated with leadership.

### Emotional Intelligence
* Another way of assessing the impact of traits on leadership is through the concept of emotional intelligence, which emerged in 1990s as an important area of study in psychology. It has been widely studied by researchers, and has captured the attention of many practioners.
* As the two words suggest, emotional intelligence has to do with our emotions (affective domain) and thinking (cognitive domain), and the interplay between the two. Whereas intelligence is concerned with our ability to learn information and apply it to life tasks, emotional intelligence is concerned with our ability to understand emotions and apply this understanding to life's tasks. Specifically, emotional intelligence can be defined as the ability to perceive and express emotions, to use emotions to facilitate thinking, to understand and reason with emotions, and to effectively manage emotions within oneself and in relationships with others.
* There are different ways to measure emotional intelligence. One scale is the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. The **MSCEIT** measures emotional intelligence as a set of mental abilities, including the abilities to perceive, facilitate, understand, and manage emotion.
* Goleman takes a broader approach to emotional intelligence, suggesting that it consists of a set of personal and social competencies. Personal competence consists of self-awareness, confidence, self-regulation, conscientiousness, and motivation. Social competence. In this model, emotional intelligent leaders are defined by 21 capacities to which a leader should pay attention, including group savvy, optimism, initiative, and teamwork.
* There is a debate in the field regarding how big a role emotional intelligence plays in helping people be successful in life. Some researchers, such as Goleman, suggested that emotional intelligence plays a major role in whether people are successful at school, home, and work. Others, such as Mayer, Salovey, and Caruso, made soft claims for the significance of emotional intelligence in meeting life's challenges.
* As a leadership ability or trait, emotional intelligence appears to be an important construct. The underlying premise suggested by this framework is that people who are more sensitive to their emotions and the impact of their emotions on others will be leaders who are more effective. As more research is conducted on emotional intelligence, the intricacies of how emotional intelligence relates to leadership will be better understood.

## HOW DOES THE TRAIT APPROACH WORK?
* The trait approach is very different from the other approaches discussed in subsequent chapters because it focuses exclusively on the leader, not on the followers on the situation. This makes the trait approach theoretically more straightforward than other approaches. In essence, the trait approach is concerned with what traits leaders exhiit and who has these traits.
* The trait approach does not lay out a set of hypotheses or principles about what kind of leader is needed in a certain situation on what a leader should do, given a particular set of circumstances. Instead, this approach emphasizes that having a leader with a certain set of traits is crucial to having effective leadership. It is the leader and the leader's personality that are central to the leaderrship process.
* The trait approach suggests that organizations will work better if the people in managerial positions have designated leadership profiles. To find the right people, it is common for organizations to use personality assessment instruments. The assumption behind these procedures is that selecting the right people will increase organizational effectiveness. Organizations can specify the characteristics or traits that are important to them for particular positions and then use personality assessment measures to determine whether an individual fits their needs.
* The trait approach is also used for personal awareness and development. By analyzing their own traits, managers can gain an idea of their strengths and weaknesses, and can get a feel for how others in the organization see them. A trait assessment can help managers determine whether they have the qualities to move up or to move to other positions in the company.
* A trait assessment gives individuals a clearer picture of who they are as leaders and how they fit into the organizational hierarchy. In areas where their traits are lacking, leaders can try to make changes in what they do or where they work to increase their traits' potential impact.
* Near the end of the chapter, a leadership instrument is provided that you can use to assess your leadership traits. This instrument is typical of the kind of personality tests that companies use to assess individuals' leadership potential. As you will discover by completing this instrument, trait measures are a good way to assess your own characteristics.

## STRENGTHS
* The trait approach has several identifiable strengths. First, the trait approach is intuitively appealing. It fits clearly with our notion that leaders are the individuals who are out front and leading the way in our society. The image in the popular press and community at large is that leaders are a special kind of people--people with gifts who can do extraordinary things. The trait approach is consistent with this perception because it is built on the premise that leaders are different, and their difference resides in the special traits they possess. People have a need to see their leaders as gifted people, and the trait approach fulfills this need.
* A second strength of the trait approach is that it has a century of research to back it up. No other theory can boast of the breadth and depth of studies conducted on the trait approach. The strength and longevity of this line of research give the trait approach a measure of credibility that other approaches lack. Out of this abundance of research has emerged a body of data that points to the important role of various personality traits in the leadership process.
* Another strength, more conceptual in nature, results from the way the trait appraoch highlights the leader component in the leadership process. Leadership is devoted to only the first of these--leaders. Although this is also a potential weakness, by focusing exclusively on the role of the leader in leadership the trait approach has been able to provide us with a deeper and more intricate understanding of how the leader and the leader's personality are related to the leadership process.
* Last, the trait approach has given us some benchmarks for what we need to look for if we want to be leaders. It identifies what traits we should have and whether the traits we do have are the best traits for leadership. Based on the findings of this approach, personality and assessment procedures can be used to offer invaluable information to supervisors and managers about their strengths and weaknesses and way to improve their overall leadershiip effectiveness.

## CRITICISMS
* In addition to its strengths, the trait approach has several weaknesses. First and foremost is the failure of the trait approach to delimit a definitive list of leadership traits. Although an enormous number of studies have been conducted over the past 100 years, the findings from these studies have been ambiguous and uncertain at times. Furthermore, the list of traits that has emerged appears endless. This is obvious from Table 2.1, which lists a multitude of traits. In fact, these are only a sample of the many leadership traits that were studied.
* Another criticism is that the trait approach has failed to take situations into account. As Stogdill pointed out more than 50 years ago, it is difficult to isolate a set of traits that are characteristic of leaders without also factoring situational effects into the equation. People who possess certain traits that make them leaders in one situation may not be leaders in another situation. Some people may have the traits that help them emerge as leaders but not the traits that allow them to maintain their leadership over time. In other words, the situation influences leadership. It is therefore difficult to identify a universal set of leadership traits in isolation from the context in which the leadership occurs.
* A third criticism, derived from the prior two criticisms, is that this approach has resulted in highly subjective determinations of the most important leadership traits. Because the findings on traits have been so extensive and broad, there has been much subjective interpretation of the meaning of the data. This subjectivity is readily apparent in the many self-help, practice-oriented management books. For example, one author might identify ambition and creativity as crucial leadership traits; another might identify empathy and calmness. In both cases, it is the author's subjective experience and observations that are the basis for the identified leadership traits. These books may be helpful to readers because they identify and describe important leadership traits, but the methods used to generate these lists of traits are weak. To respond to people's need for a set of definitive traits of leaders, authors have set forth lists of traits, even if the origins of these lists are not grounded in strong, reliable research.
* Research on traits can also be criticized for failing to look at traits in relationship to leadership outcomes. This research has emphasized the identification of traits, but has not addressed how leadership traits affect group members and their work. In trying to ascertain universal leadership traits, researchers have focused on the link between specific traits and leader emergence, but they have not tried to link leader traits with other outcomes such as productiviy or employee satisfaction. For example, trait research does not provide data on whether leaders who might have high intelligence and strong integrity have better results than leaders without these traits. The trait research is weak in describing how leaders' traits affect the outcomes of groups and teams in organizational settings.
* A final criticism of the trait approach is that it is not a useful approach for training and development for leadership. Even if definitive traits could be identified, teaching new traits is not an easy process because traits are not easily changed. For example, it is not reasonable to send managers to a trainging program to raise their IQ or to train them to become extroverted. The point is that traits are largely fixed psychological structures, and this limits the value of teaching and leadership training.

## APPLICATION
* Despite its shortcomings, the trait approach provides valuable information about leadership. It can be applied by individuals at all levels and in all types of organizations. Although the trait approach does not provide a definitive set of traits, it does provide direction regarding which traits are good to have if one aspires to a leadership position. By taking personality tests and other similar questionnaires, people can gain insight into whether they have certain traits deemed important for leadership, and they can pinpoint their strengths and weaknesses with regard to leadership.
* As we discuss previously, managers can use information fro mthe trait approach to assess where they stand in their organization and what they need to do to strengthen their position. Trait information can suggest areas in which their personal characteristics are very beneficial to the company and areas in which they may watn to get more training to enhance their overall approach. Using trait information, managers can develop a deeper understanding of who they are and how they will affect others in the organization.

## CASE STUDIES
* In this section, three case studies (Cases 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) are provided to illustrate the trait approach and to help you understand how the trait approach can be used in making decisions in organizational settings. The settings of the case are diverse--directing a research department, running an office supply business, and being of recruitment for a large bank--but all of the cases deal with trait leadership. At the end of each case, you will find questions that will help in analyzing the cases

#### CASE 2.1: Choosing a New Director of Research
* Sandra Coke is vice president for research and development at Great Lakes Food (GLF), a large snack food company that has approximately 1,000 employees. As a result of a recent reorganization, Sandra must choose the new director of research. The director will report directly to Sandra and will be responsible for developing and testing new products. The research division of GLF employs about 200 people. The choice of directors is important because Sandra is receiving pressure from the president and board of GLF to improve the company's overall growth and productivity.
* Sandra has identified three candidates for the position. Each candidate is at the same managerial level. She is having difficult choosing one of them because each has very strong credentials. Alexa Smith is a longtim employee of GLF who started part-time in the mailroom while in high school. After finishing school, Alexa worked in as many as 10 different positions through the company to become manager of new product marketing. Performance reviews of Alexa's work have repeatedly described her as being very creative and insightful. In her tenure at GLF, Alexa has developed and brought to market four new product lines. Alexa is also known throughout GLF as being very persistent about her work: When she starts a project, she stays with it until it is finished. It is probably this quality that accounts for the success of each of the four new products with which she has been involved.
* A second candidate for the new position is Kelsey Metts, who has been with GLF for 5 years and is manager of quality control for established products. Kelsey has a reputation of being very bright. Before joining GLF, she received her MBA at Harvard, graduating at the top of her class. People talk about Kelsey as the kind of person who will be president of her own company someday. Kelsey is also very personable. On all her performance reviews, she received extra-high scores on sociability and human relations. There isn't a supervisor in the company who doesn't have positive things to say about how comfortable it is to work with Kelsey. Since joining GLF, Kelsey has been instrumental in bringing two new product lines to market.
* Thomas Santiago, the third candidate, has been with GLF for 10 years and is often consulted by upper management regarding strategic planning and corporate direction setting. Thomas has been very involved in establishing the vision for GLF and is a company person all the way. He believes in the values of GLF, and actively promotes its mission. The two qualities that stand out above the rest in Thomas's performance reviews are his honesty and integrity. Employees who have worked under his supervision consistently report that they feel they can trust Thomas to be fair and consistent. Thomas is highly respected at GLF. In his tenure at the company, Thomas has been involved in some capacity with development of three new product lines.
* The challenge confronting Sandra is to choose the best person for the newly established director's position. Because of the pressure she feels from upper management, Sandra knows she must select the best leader for the new position.

Questions
1. Based on the information provided about the trait approach in Table 2.1 and 2.2, if you were Sandra, who would you select?
2. In what ways is the trait approach helpful in this type of selection?
3. In what ways are weaknesses of the trait approach highlighted in this case?

#### CASE 2.2: A Remarkable Turnaround
* Carol Baines was married for 20 years to the owner of the Baines Company until he died in a car accident. After his death, Carol decided not to sell the business but to try to run it herself. Before the accident, her only involvement in the business was in informal discussions with her husband over dinner, although she has a college degree in business, with a major in management.
* Baines Company was one of three office stores in a city with a population of 200,000 people. The other two stores were owned by national chains. Baines not was a large company, and employed only five people a year, serving mostly the smaller companies in the city. The firm had not grown in a number years and was beginning to feel the pressure of the advertising and lower prices of the national chains.
* For the first 6 moths, Carol spent her time familiarizing herself with the employees and the operations of the company. Next, she did a city-wide analysis of companies that had reason to purchase office supplies. Based on her understanding of the company's capabilities and her assessment of the potential market for their products and services, Carol developeed a specific set of short-term and long-term goals for the company. Behind all of her planning, Carol had a vision that Baines could be viable, healthy, and competitive comapny. She wanted to carry on the business that her husband had started, but more than that she wanted it to grow.
* Over the first 5 years, Carol invested significant amounts of money in advertising, sales, and services. These effort were well spent because the company began to show rapid growth immediately. Because of the growth, the company hired another 20 people. 
* The expansion at Baines was particularly remarkable because of another major hardship Carol had to confront. Carol was diagnosed with breast cancer a year after her husband died. The treatment for her cancer included 2 months of radiation therapy and 6 months of strong chemotherapy. Although the side effects included hair loss and fatigue, Carol continued to manage the comapny thoughout the ordeal. Despite her difficulties, Carol was successful. Under the strength of her leadership, the growth at Baines continued for 10 consecutive years.
* Interviews with new and old employees at Baines revealed much about Carol's leadership. Employees said that Carol was a very solid person. She cared deeply about others and was fair and considerate. They said she created a family-like atmosphere at Baines. Few employees had quit Baines since Carol took over. Carol was devoted to all the employees, and she supported their interests. For example, the company sponsored a softball team in the summer a nd a basketball team in the winter. Others described Carol as a strong person. Even through she had cancer, she continued to be positive and interested in them. She did not get depressed about the cancer and its side effects, even though coping with cancer was difficult. Employees said she was a model of strength, goodness, and quality.
* At age 55, Carol turned the business over to her two sons. She continues to act as the president but does not supervise the day-to-day operations. The company is doing more than $3.1 million in sales, and it outpaces the other two chain stores in the city.

Questions
1. How would you describe Carol's leadership traits?
2. How big a part did Carol's traits play in the expansion of the company?
3. Would Carol be a leader in other business context?

#### CASE 2.3: Recruiting for the Bank
* Pat Nelson is the assistant director of human resources in charge of recruitment for Central Bank, a large, full-service banking institution. One of Pat's major responsibilities each spring is to visit as many college campus as he can to interview graduating seniors for credit analyst positions in the commercial lending area at Central Bank. Although the number varies, he usually ends up hiring about 20 new people, most of whom come from the same schools, year after year.
* Pat has been doing recruitment for the bank for more than 10 years, and he enjoys it very much. However, for the upcoming spring he is feeling increased pressure from management to be particularly discriminating about whom he recommends hiring. Management is concerned about the retention rate at the bank because in recent years as many as 25% of the new hires have left. Departures after the first year have meant lost training dollars and strain on the staff who remain. Although management understands that some new hires always leave, the executives are not comfortable with the present rate, and they have begun to question the recruitment and hiring procedures.
* The bank wants to hire people who can be groomed for higher-level leadership positions. Although certain competencies are required of entry-level credit analysts, the bank is equally interested in skills that will allow individuals to advance to upper management positions as their careers progress.
* In the recruitment process, Pat always loooks for several characteristics. First, applicants need to have strong interpersonal skills, they need to be confident, and they need to show poise and initiative. Next, because banking involves fiduciary responsibilities, applicants need to have proper ethics, including a strong sense of the importance of confidentiality. In addition, to do the work in the bank, they need to have strong analytical and technical skills, and experience in working with computers. Last, applicants need to exhibit a good work ethic, and they need to show commitment and a willingness to do their job even in difficult circumstances.
* Pat is fairly certain that he has been selecting the right people to be leaders at Central Bank, yet upper management is telling him to reassess his hiring criteria. Although he feels that he has been doing the right thing, he is starting to question himself and his recruitment practices.

Questions
1. Based on ideas described in the trait approach, do you think Pat is looking for the right characteristics in the people he hires?
2. Could it be that the retention problem raised by upper management is unrelated to Pat's recruitment criteria?
3. If you were Pat, would you change your approach to recruiting?

## LEADERSHIP INSTRUMENT
* Organizations use a wide variety of questionnaires to measure individuals' personality characteristics. In many organizations, it is common practice to use standard personality measures such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory of the Myers-Briggs Type indicator. These measures provide valuable information to the individual and the organization about the individual's unique attributes for leadership and where the individual could best serve the organization.
* In this section, the Leadership Trait Questionnaire (LTQ) is provided as an example of a measure that can be used to assess your personal leadership characteristics. The LTQ quantifies the perceptions of the individual leader and selected observers, such as subordinates or peers. It measures an individual's trait and points the individual to the areas in which that individual may have strengths or weaknesses.
* By taking the LTQ, you can gain an understanding of how trait measures and used for leadership assessment. You can also assess your own leadership traits

# Chapter 3: Skill Approach

## DESCRIPTION
* Like the trait approach we discussed in Chapter 2, the skills approach takes a leader-centered perspective on leadership. However, in the skills approach we shift our thinking from a focus on personality characteristics, which usually are viewed as innate and larged fixed, to an emphasis on skills and abilities that can be learned and developed. Although personality certainly plays an integral role in leadership, the skills approach suggests that knowledge and abilities are needed for effective leadership.
* Researchers have studied leadership skills directly or indirectly for a number of years. However, the impetus for research on skills was a classic article published by Robert Katz in the Harvard Business Review in 1955, titled "Skills of an Effective administrator". Katz's article appeared at a time when researchers were trying to identify a definitive set of leadership traits. Katz's approach was an attempt to transcend the trait problem by addressing leadership as a set of developable skills. More recently, a revitalized interest in the skills approach has emerged. Beginning in the early 1990s, a multitude of studies have been published that contend that a leader's effectiveness depends on the leader's ability to solve complex organizational problems. This research has resulted in a comprehensive skill-based model of leadership that was advanced by Mumford and his colleagues.
* In this chapter, our discussion of the skills approach is divided into two parts. First, we discuss the general ideas set forth by Katz regarding three **basic administrative skills: technical, human, and conceptual.** Second, we discuss the recent work of Mumford and colleagues that has resulted in a new skills-based model of organizational leadership.

### Three-Skill Approach
* Based on field research in administration and his own firsthand observations of executives in the workplace, Katz sugested that effective administration (i.e., leadership) depends on three basic personal skills: technical, human, and conceptual. Katz argued that these skills are quite different from traits or qualities of leaders. Skills are what leaders can accomplish, whereas traits are who leaders are (i.e., their innate characteristics). Leadership skills are defined in this chapter as the ability to use one's **knowledge and competencies to accomplish a set of goals or objectives.** This chapter shows that these leadership skills can be acquired and leaders can be trained to develop them.

### Technical Skill
* Technical skill in knowledge about and proficiency in a specific type of work or activity. it includes competencies in a specialized area, analytical ability, and the ability to use appropriate tools and techniques. For example, in a computer software company, technical skill might include knowing software language and programming, the company's software products, and how to make these products function for clients. Similarly, in an accounting firm, technical skill might include understanding and having the ability to apply generally accepted accounting principles to a client's audit. In both these examples, technical skills involve a hands-on activity play an essential role in producing the actual products a company is designed to produce.
* As illustrated in Figure 3.1., technical skill is most important at lower and middle levels of management and less important in upper management. For leaders at the highest level, such as chief executive officers (CEOs), presidents, and senior officers, technical competencies are not as essential. Individuals at the top level depend on skilled subordinates to handle technical issues of the physical operation.

### Human Skill
* Human skill is knowledge about the ability to work with people. It is quite different from technical skill, which has to do with working with things. Human skills are "people skills". They are the abilities that help a leader to work effectively with subordinates, peers, and superiors to accomplish the organization's goals. Human skills allow a leader to assist group members in working cooperatively as a group to achieve common goals. For Katz, it means being aware of one's own perspective on issues and, at the same time, being aware of the perspective of others. Leaders with human skills adapt their own ideas to those of others. Furthermore, they create an atmostphere of trust where employees can feel comfortable and secure and where they can feel encouraged to become involved in the planning of things that will affect them. Being a leader with human skills means being sensitve to the needs and motivations of others and taking into account others' needs in one's decision making. In short, human skill is the capacity to get along with others as you go about your work.
* In Figure 3.1, human skills are important in all three levels of management. Although managers at lower levels may communicate with a far great number of employees, human skills are equally important at middle and upper levels.

### Conceptual Skill
* Broadly speaking, conceptual skills are the ability to work with ideas and concepts. Whereas technical skills deal with things and human skills deal with people, conceptual skills involve the ability to work with ideas. A leader with conceptual skills is comfortable talking about the ideas that shape an organization and the intricacies involved. He or she is good at putting the company's goals into words and can understand and express the economic principles that affect the company. A leader with conceptual skills works easily with abstractions and hypothetical notions.
* Conceptual skills are central to creating a vision and strategic plan for an organization. For example, it would take conceptual skills for a CEO in a struggling manufacturing company to articulate a vision for a line of new products that would steer the company into profitability. Similarly, it would take conceptual skill for the director of a nonprofit health organization to create a strategic plan that could compete successfully with for-profit health organizations in a market with scarce resources. The point of these examples is that conceptual skill has to do with the mental work of shaping the meaning of organizational or policy issues--understanding what a commpany stands for and where it is or should be going.
* In Figure 3.1., conceptual skill is most important at the top management levels. In fact, when upper-level managers do not have strong conceptual skills, they can jeopardize the whole organization. Conceptual skills are also important in middle management; as we move down to lower management levels, conceptual skills become less important.

### Summary of the Three-Skill Approach
* To summarize, the three-skill approach includes technical, human, and conceptual skills. It is important for leaders to have all three skills; depending on where they are in the management structure, however, some skills are more important than others are.
* Katz's work in the mid-1950 set the stage for conceptualizing leadership in terms of skills, but it was not until the mid-1990s that an empirically-based skills approach received recognition in leadership research. In the next section, the comprehensive skill-based model of leadership presented.

### Skill Model
* Beginning in the early 1990s, a group of researchers, with funding from the U.S., Army and Department of Defence, set out to test and develop a comprehensive theory of leadership based on problem-solving skills in organizations. The studies were conducted over a number of years using a sample of more than 1,800 Army officers, representing six grade levels, from second lieutenant to colonel. The project used a variety of new measures and tools to assess the skills of these officers, their experiences, and the situations in which they worked.
* The researchers' main goal was to explain the underlying elements of effective performance. They addressed questions such as these: What accounts for why some leaders are good problem solvers and others are not? What specific skills do high-performing leaders exhibit? How do leaders' individual characteristics, career experiences, and environmental influences affect their job performance? As a whole, researchers wanted to identify the leadership factors that create exemplary job performance in an actual organization.
* Based on the extensive findings from the project, Mumford and colleagues forumated a skill-based model of leadership. The model is characterized as a capability model because it examines the relationship between a leader's knowledge and skills (i.e., capabilities) and the leader's performance. Leadership capabilities can be developed over time through education and experience. Unlike the "great man" approach, which implies that leadership is reserved for only the gifted few, the skills approach suggests that many people have the potential for leadership. If people are capable of learning from their experiences, they can acquire leadership. The skills approach can also be distinguish from the leadership approaches we will discuss in subsequent chapters, which focus on behavioral patterns of leaders (e.g., the style approach, transformational leadership, or leader-member exchange theory). Rather than emphasizing what leaders do, the skills approach frames leadership as the capabilities (knowledge and skills) that make effective leadership possible.
* The skill-based model of Mumford's group has five components: comptencies, individual attributes, leadership outcomes, career experiences, and environmental influences. A portion of the model, illustrating three of these components, appears in Figure 3.2. This portion of the model is essential to understanding the overall skill-based leadership model.

### Competencies
* As can be observed in the middle box in Figure 3.2, problem-solving skills, social judgment skills, and knowledge are at the heart of the skills model. These three competencies are the key factors that account for effective performance.
* **Problem-Solving Skills**. What are problem-solving skills? According to Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, problem-solving skills are a leader's creative ability to solve new and unusual, ill-defined organizational problems. The skills include being able to define significant problems, gather problem information, formulate new understandings about the problem, and generate prototype plans for problem solutions. These skills do not function in a vacuum, but are carried out in an organizational context. Problem-solving skills demand that leaders understand their own leadership capacities as they apply possible solutions to the unique problems in their organization.
* Being able to construct solutiosn plays a special role in problem solving. In considering solutions to organizational problems, skilled leaders need to attend to the time frame for constructing and implementing a solution, short-term and long-term goals, career goals and organizational goals, and external issues, all of which could influence the solution.
* To clarify what is meant by problem-solving skills, consider the following hypothetical situation. Imagine that you are the director of human resources for a medium-sized company and you have been informed by the president that you have to develop a plan to reduce the company's health care costs. In deciding what you will do, you coould demonstrate problem-solving skills in the following ways. First, you identify the full ramifications for employees of changing their health insurance coverage. What is the impact going to be? Second, you gather information about how benefits can be scaled back. What other companies have attempted a similar change, and what were their results? Third, you find a way to teach and inform the employees about the needed change. how can you frame the change in such a way that it is clearly understood? Fourth, you create possible scenarios for how the changes will understood? Fourth, you create possible scenarios for how the changes will be instituted. How will the plan be described? Fifth, you look closely at the solution itself. How will implementing this change affect the company's mission and your own career? Last, are there issues in the organization (e.g., union rules) that may affect the implementation of these changes?
* As illustrated by this example, the process of dealing with novel, ill-defined organizational problems is complex and demanding for leaders. In many ways, it is like a puzzle to be solved. For leaders to solve such puzzles, the skill-based model suggests that problem-solving skills are essential.

### Social Judgment Skills
* In addition to problem-solving skills, effective leadership performance also requires social judgment skills. In general, social judgment skills are the capacity to understand people and social systems. They enable leaders to work with others to solve problems and to marshal support to implement change within an organization. Social judgment skills are the people skills that are necessary to solve unique organizational problems.
* Conceptually, social judgment skills are similar to Katz's early work on the role of human skill management. In constrast to Katz's work, Mumford and colleagues have delineated social judgment skills into the following: perspective taking, social perceptiveness, behavioural flexibility, and social performance.
* Perspective taking means understanding the attitudes that others have toward a particular problem or solution. It is empathy applied to problem solving. Perspective taking means being sensitve to other people's perspectives and goals--being able to understand their point of view on different issues. Included in perspective taking is knowing how different constituencies in an organization view a problem and possible solutions. According to Zaccaro, Gilbert, Thor, and Mumford, perspective-taking skills can be likened to social intelligence. These skills are concerned with knowledge about people, the social fabric of organizations, and the inter-relatedness of each of them.
* Social perceptiveness is insight and awareness into how others in the organization function. What is important to others? What motivates them? What problems do they face, and how do they react to change? Social perceptiveness means understanding the unique needs, goals, and demands of different organizational constituencies. A leader with social perceptiveness has a keen sense of how employees will respond to any proposed change in the organization. In a sense, you could say it allows the leader to know the pulse of employees on any issue at any time.
* In addition to understanding others accurately, social judgment skills also involve reacting to others with flexibility. Behavioural flexibility is the capacity to change and adapt one's behavior in light of an understanding of others' perspectives in the organization. Being flexible means one is not locked into a singular approach to a problem. One is not dogmatic but rather maintains an openness and willingness to change. As the circumstances of a situation change, a flexible leader changes to meet the new demands.
* Social performance includes a wide range of leadership competencies. Based on an understanding of employees' perspectives, leaders need to be able to communicate their own vision to others. Skill in persuasion and communicating change is essential to do this. When there is resistance to change or interpersonal conflict about change, leaders need to function as mediators. To this end, skill in conflict resolution is an important aspect of social performance competency. In addition, social performance sometimes requires that leaders coach subordinates, giving them direction and support as they move toward selected organizational goals. In all, social performance includes many related skills that may come under the umbrella of communication.
* To review, social judgment skills are about being sensitive to how your dieas fit in with others. Can you understand others' perspectives and their unique needs and motivaitons? Are you flexible, and can you adapt your own ideas to others? Can you work with others even when there is resistance and conflict? Social judgment skills are the people skills needed to advance change in an organization.

### Knowledge
* As shown in the model, the third aspect of competencies is knowledge. Knowledge is inextricably related to the application and implementation of problem-solving skills in organizations. It directly influences a leader's capacity to define complex organizational problems and to attempt to solve them. Knowledge is the accumulation of information and the mental structures used to organize that information. Such a mental structure is called a schema (a summary, a diagrammatic representation, or an outline). Knowledge results from having developed an assortment of complex schemata for learning and organzing data.
* For example, all of us take various kinds of facts and information into our minds. As we organize that information into categories or schemata, the information becomes more meaningful. Knowledge emerges from the facts and the organizational structures we apply to them. People with a lot of knowledge have more complex organizing structures than those with less knowledge. These knowledgeable people are called experts.
* Consider the following baseball example. A baseball expert knows a lot of facts about the game; the expert knows the rules, strategies, equipment, players, and much, much more. The expert's knowledge about baseball includes the facts, but it also includes the complex mental structures used in organizing and structuring those facts. That person knows not only the season and lifetime statistics for each player, but also that player's quirks and injuries, the personality of the manager, the strengths and weaknesses of available substitutes, and so on. The expert knows baseball becasue she or he comprehends the complexities and nuances of the game. The same is true for leadership in organization. Leaders with knowledge know much about the products, the tasks, the people, the organization, and all the different ways these elements are related to each other. A knowledgeable leader has many mental structures with which to organize the facts of organizational life.
* Knowledge has a positive impact on how leaders engage in problem solving. It is knowledge and expertise that make it possible for people to think about complex system issues and identify possible strategies for appropriate change. Furthermore, this capacity allows people to use prior cases and incidents in order to plan for needed change. It is knowledge that allows people to use the past to constructively confront the future.
* To summarize, the skill model consists of three competencies: problem-solving skills, social judgment skills, and knowledge. Collectively, these three components are positively related to effective leadershuip performance.

### Individual Attributes
* Returning to Figure 3.2, the box on the left identifies four individual attributes that have an impact on leadership skills and knowledge: general cognitive ability, crystallized cognitive ability, motivation, and personality. These attributes play important roles in the skills model. Complex problem solving is a very difficult process and becomes more difficult as people move up in the organization. These attributes support people as they apply their leadership competencies.

##### General Cognitive Ability
* General cognitive ability can be thought of as a person's intelligence. It includes perceptual processing, information processing, general reasoning skills, creative and divergent thinking capacities, and memory skills. General cognitive ability is linked to biology, not to experience.
* General cognitive ability is sometimes described as fluid intelligence, a type of intelligence that usually grows and expands up through early adulthood and then declines with age. In the skills model, intelligence is described as having a positive impact on the leader's acquisition of complex problem-solving skills and the leader's knowledge.

##### Crystallized Cognitive Ability
* Crystallized cognitive ability is intellectual ability that is learned or acquired over time. It is the store of knowledge we acquire through experience. We learn and increase our capacities over a lifetime, increasing our leadership potential (e.g., problem-solving skills, conceptual ability, and social judgment skills). In normally functioning adults, this type of cognitive ability grows continuously and typically does not fall off in adulthood. It includes being able to comprehend complex information and learn new skills and information, as well as being able to communicate to others in oral and written forms. Stated another way, crytallized cognitive ability is acquired intelligence: the ideas and mental abiltiies people learn through experience. Because it stays fairly stable over time, this type of intelligence is not diminished as people get older.

##### Motivation
* Motivation is listed as the third attribute in the model. Although the model does not purport to explain the many ways in which motivation may affect leadership, it does suggest three aspects of motivation that are essential to developing leadership skills. First, leaders must be willing to tackle complex organizational problems. This first step is critical. For leadership to occur, a person wants to lead. Second, leaders must be willing to express dominance--to exert their influence, as we discussed in Chapter 2. In influencing others, the leader must take on the responsibility of dominance because the influence component of leadership is inextricable bound to dominance. Third, leaders must be committed to the social good of the organization. The social good is a broad term that can refer to a host of outcomes. However, in the skills model it refers to the leader's willingness to take on the responsibility of trying to advance the overall human good and value of the organization. Taken together, these three aspects of motivation (willingness, dominance, and social good) prepare people to become leaders.

##### Personality
* Personality is the fourth individual attribute in the skills model. Placed where it is in the model, this attribute reminds us that our personality has an impact on the devbelopment of our leadership skills. For example, openness, tolerance for ambiguity, and curiosity may affect a leader's motivation to try to solve some organizational problem. Or, in conflict situations, traits such as confidence and adaptability may be beneficial to a leader's performance. The skills model hypothesizes that any personality characteristic that helps people to cope with complex organizational situations probably is related to leader performance.

##### Leadership Outcomes
* In the right-hand box in Figure 3.2, effective problem solving and performance are the outcomes of leadership. These outcomes are strongly influenced by the leader's competencies (i.e, problem-solving skills, social judgment skills, and knowledge). When leaders exhibit these competencies, they increase their chances of problem solving and overall performance.

##### Effective Problem Solving
* As we discussed earlier, the skills model is a capacity model, designed to explain why some leaders are good problem solvers and others are not. Problem solving is the keystone is the skills approach. In the model (see Figure 3.2), problem-solving skills, as competencies, lead to effective problem solving as a leadership outcome. The criteria for good problem solving are determined by the originality and the quality of expressed solutions to problems. Good problem solving involves creating solutions that are logical, effective, and unique, and that go beyond given information.

##### Performance
* In the model, performance outcomes reflect how well the leader has done her or his job. To measure performance, standard external criteria are used. If the leader has done well and been successful, the leader's evaluations will be positive. Leaders who are effective receive good annual performance reviews, get merit raises, and are recognized by superiors and subordinates as competent leaders. In the end, performance is the degree to which a leader has successfully performed the assigned duties.
* Taken together, effective problem solving and performance are the two ways to assess leadership effectiveness using the skills model. Furthermore, good problem solving and good performance go hand in hand. A full depiction of the comprehensive skills model appears in Figure 3.3. It contains two other components, not depicted in Figure 3.2, that contribute to overall leadership performance: career experiences and environmental influences.

### Career Experiences
* As you can see in Figure 3.3, career experiences have an impact on the characteristics and competencies of leaders. The skills model suggests that the experiences acquired in the course of leaders' careers influence their knowledge and skills to solve complex problems. Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, et al. pointed out that leaders ca nbe helped through challenging job assignments, mentoring, appropriate training, and hands-on experience in solving new and unusual problems. In addition, the authors think that career experiences can positively affect the individual characteristics of leaders. For example, certain on-the-job assignments could enhance a leader's motivation or intellectual ability.
* In the first section of this chapter, we discussed Katz's work, which notes that conceptual skills are essential for upper-level administrations. This is consistent with Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, et al.'s skills model, which contends that leaders develop competencies over time. Career experience helps leaders to improve their skills and knowledge over time. Leaders learn and develop higher levels of conceptual capacity if the kinds of problem they confront are progressively more complex and more long term as they ascend the organizational hierarchy. Similarly, upper-level leaders, as opposed to first-line supervisors, develop new competencies because they are required to address problems that are more novel, that are more poorly defined, and that demand more human interaction. As these people move through their careers, higher levels of problem-solving and social judgment skills become increasingly important.
* So the skills and knowledge of leaders are shaped by their career experiences as they address increasingly complex problems in the organization. This notion of developing leadership skills is unique and quite different from other leadership perspectives. If we say, "Leaders are shaped by their experiences", then it means leadres are not born to be leaders. Leaders can develop their abilities through experience, according the skills model.

### Environmental Influences
* The final component of the skills model is environmental influences, which is illustrated at the bottom of Figure 3.3. Environmental influences represent factors that lie outside the leader's competencie, characteristics, and experience. These environmental influences can be internal and external.
* Internal environmental influences affecting leadership performance can include such factors as technology, facilities, expertise of subordinates, and communication. For example, an aging factory or one lacking in high-speed technology could have a major impact on the nature of problem-solving activities. Another example might be the skill levels of subordinates: If a leader's subordinates are highly competent, they will definitely improve the group's problem solving and performance. Similarly, if a task is particularly complex or a group's communication poor, the leader's performance will be affected.
* External environmental influences, including economic, political, and social issues, as well as natural disasters, can provide unique challenges to leaders. In March 2011, a massive earthquake and tsunami devastated large parts of Japan, crippling that nation's automobile manufacturing industry. Toyota Motor Corp. alone had more than 650 of its suppliers and component manufacturer wiped out, halting worldwide production of Toyota vehicles and devastating the company's sales. At the same time, this disaster was a boon to American carmakers who increased shipments and began outselling Toyota, which had dominated the market. Leaders of these automobile companies, both Japan and American, had to respond to unique challenges posed by external forces completely beyond their control.
* The skills model does not provide an inventory of specific environmental influences. Instead, it acknowledges the existence of these factors and recognizes that they are indeed influences that can affect a leader's performance. In other words, environmental influences are a part of the skills model but not usually under the control of the leader.

### Summary of the Skills Model
* In summary, the skills model frames leadership by describing five components of leader performance. At the heart of the model are three competencies: problem-solving skills, social judgment skills, and knowledge. These three competencies are the central determinants of effective problem solving and performance, although individual attributes, career experiences, and environmental influences all have impacts on leader competencies. Through job experience and training, leaders can become better problem solvers and more effective leaders.

## HOW DOES THE SKILLS APPROACH WORK?
* The skills approach is primarily descriptive: It describes leadership from a skill perspective. Rather than providing prescriptions for success in leadership, the skills approach provides a structure for understanding the nature of effective leadereship. In the previous sections, we discussed the skills perspective based on the work of Katz and Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, et all. What does each of these bodies of work suggest about the structure and functions of leadership?
* The three-skill approach of Katz suggests that the importance of certain leadership skills varies depending on where leaders are in a management hierarchy. For leaders operating at lower levels of management, technical and human skills are most important. When leaders move into middle management, it becomes important that they have all three skills: technical, human , and conceptual. At the upper management levels, it is paramount for leaders to exhibit conceptual and human skills.
* This approach was reinforced in 2007 study that examined the skills needed by executives at different levels of management. The researchers used a four-skill model, similar to Katz's approach, to assess cognitive skills, interpersonal skills, business skill, and strategic skills of 1,000 managers at the junior, middle, and senior levels of an organization. The results showed the interpersonal and cognitive skills were required more than business and strategic skills for those on the lower levels of management. As one climbed the career ladder, however, the execution of higher levels of all four of these leadership skills became necessary.
* In their skills model, Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding et al. provided a more complex picture of how skills relate to the manifestation of effective leadership. Their skills model contend that leadership outcomes are the direct result of leader's competencies in problem-solving skills, social judgment skills, and knowledge. Each of these competencies includes a large repertoire of abilities, and each can be learned and developed. In addition, the model illustrates how individual attributes such as general cognitive ability, crystallized cognitive ability, motivation, and personality influence the leader's competencies. And finally, the model describes how career experiences and environmental influences play a direct or indirect role in leadership performance.
* The skills approach works by providing a map of how to reach effective leadership in an organization: Leaders need to have problem-solving skills, social judgment skills, and knowledge. Workers can improve their capabilities in these areas through training and experience. Although each leader's personal attributes affect his or her skills, it is the leader's skills themselves that are most important in addressing organizational problems.

## STRENGTHS
* In several ways, the skills approach contributes positively to our understanding about leadership. First, it is a leader-centered model that stresses the importance of developing particular leadership skills. It is the first approach to conceptualize and create a structure of the process of leadreship around skills. Whereas the early research on skills highlighted the importance of skills and the value of skills across different management levels, the later work placed learned skills at the center of effective leadership performance at all management levels.
* Second, the skills approach is intuitively appealing. To describe leadership in terms of skills makes leadership available to everyone. Unlike personality traits, skills are competencies that people can learn or develop. It is like playing a sport such as tennis or golf. Even without natual ability in these sports, people can improve their games with practice and instruction. The same is true with leadership. When leadership is framed as a set of skills, it becomes a process that people can study and practice to become better at performing their jobs.
* Third, the skills approach provides an expansive view of leadership that incorporates a wide variety of components, including problem-solving skills, social judgment skills, knowledge, individual attributes, career experiences, and environmental influences. Each of these components can further be subdivided into several subcomponents. The result is a picture of leadership that encompasses a multitude of factors. Because it includes so many variables, the skills approach can capture many of the intricacies and complexities of leadership not found in other models.
* Last, the skills approach provides a structure that is very consistent with the curricula of most leadership education programs. Leadership education programs throughout the country have traditional taught classes in creative problem solving, conflict resolution, listening and teamwork, to name a few. The content of these classes closely mirrors many of the components in the skills model. Clearly, the skills approach provides a structure that helps to frame the cirricula of leadership education and development programs.

## CRITICISMS
* Like all other approaches to leadership, the skills approach also has certain weaknesses. First, the breadth of the skills approach seems to extend beyond the boundaries of leadership. For example, by including motivation, critical thinking, personality, and conflict resolution, the skills approach addresses more than just leadership. Another example of the model's breadth is its inclusion of two types of intelligence (i.e., general cognitive ability and crystallized cognitive ability). Although both areas are studied widely in the field of cognitive psychology, they are seldom addressed in leadership research. By including so many components, the skills model of Mumford and others becomes more general and less precise in explaining leadership performance.
* Second, related to the first criticism, the skills model is weak in predictive value. It does not explain specifically how variations in social judgment skills and problem-solving skills affect performance. The model suggests that these components are related, but it does not describe with any precision just how that works. In short, the model can be faulted because it does not explain how skills lead to effective leadership performance.
* In addition, the skills approach can be crticized for claiming not to be a trait model when, in fact, a major component in the model includes individual attributes, which are trait-like. Although Mumford and colleagues describe cognitive abilitiies, motivation, and personality variables as factors contributing to competencies, these are also factors that are typically considered to be trait variables. The point is that the individual attributes component of the skills model is trait driven, and that shifts the model away from being strictly a skills approach to leadership.
* The final criticism of the skills approach is that it may not be suitably or appropriately applied to other contexts of leadership. The skills model was constructed by using a large sample of military personnel and observing their performance in the armed services. This raises an obvious question: Can the results be generalized to other populations or organizational settings? Although some research suggests that these Army findings can be generalized to other groups, more research is needed to address this criticism.

## APPLICATION
* Despite its appeal to theorists and academics, the skills approach has not been widely used in applied leadership settings. For example, there are no training packages designed specifically to teach people leadership skills from this approach. Although many programs have been designed to teach leadership skills from a general self-help orientation, few of these programs are based on the conceptual frameworks set forth in this chapter.
* Despite the lack of formal training programs, the skills approach offers valuable information about leadership. The approach provides a way to delinerate the skills of the leader, and leaders at all levels in an organization can use it. In addition, this approach helps us to identify our strengths and weaknesses in regard to these technical, human, and conceptual skills. By taking a skills inventory such as the one provided at the end of this chapter, people can gain further insight into their own leadership competencies. Their scores allow them to learn about areas in which they may want to seek further training to enhance their overall contributions to their organization.
* From a wider perspective, the skills approach may be used in the future as a template for the design of extensive leadership development programs. This approach provides the evidence for teaching leaders the important aspects of listening, creative proble solving, conflict resolution skills, and much more.

## CASE STUDIES
* The following three case studies (Case 3.1, 3.2, 3.3) describe leadership situations that can be analyzed and evaluated from the skills perspective. The first case involves the principal investigator of a federal funded research grant. The second case takes place in a military setting and describes how a lieutenant colonel handles the downsizing of a military base. In the third case, we learn about how the owner of an Italian restaurant has created his own recipe for success.
* As you read each case, try to apply the principles of the skills approach to the leaders and their situations. At the end of each case are questions that will assist you in analyzing the case.

## CASE 3.1: A Strained Research Team
* Dr. Adam Wood is the principal investigator on a 3-year, $1 million federal funded research grant to study health education programs for older populations, called the Elder Care Project. Unlike previous projects, in which Dr. Wood worked alone or with one or two other investigators, orn this project Dr. Wood has 11 colleagues. His project team is made up of two co-investigators (with PhDs), four intervention staff (with MAs), and five general staff members (with BAs). One year into the project, it has become apparent to Dr. Wood and the team that the project is underbudgeted and has too few resources. Team members are spending 20%-30% more time on the project than has been budgeted to pay them. Regardless of the resource strain, all team members are committed to the project; they believe in its goals and the importance of its outcomes. Dr. Wood is known thorughout the country as the foremost scholar in this area of health education research. He is often asked to serve on national review and advisory boards. His publication record is second to none. In addition, his colleagues in the university know Dr. Wood as a very competent researcher. People come to Dr. Wood for advice on research design and methodology questions. They also come to him for questions about theoretical formulations. He has a reputation as someone who can see the big picture on research projects.
* Despite his research competence, there are problems on Dr. Wood's research team. Dr. Wood worries there is a great deal of work to be done but that the members of the team are not devoting sufficient time to the Elder Care Project. he is frustrated because many of the day-to-day research tasks of the project are falling into his lap. He enters a research meeting, throws his notebook down on the table, and says, "I wish I'd never taken this project on. It's taking way too much of my time. The rest of you aren't pulling your fair share." Team members feel exasperated as Dr. Wood's comments. Although they respect his competence, they find his leadership style frustrating. His negative comments at staff meetings are having a demoralizing effect on the research team. Despite their hard work and devotion to the project. Dr. Wood seldom compliments on praises their efforts. Team members believe that they have spent more time than anticipated on the project and have received less pay or credit than expected. The project is sucking away a lot of staff energy, yet Dr. Wood does not seem to understand the pressures confronting his staff.
* The research staff is starting to feel burned out, but members realize they need to keep trying because they are under time constraints from the federal government to do the work promised. The team needs to develop a pamphlet for the participants in the Elder Care Project, but the pamphlet costs are significantly more than budgeted in the grant. Dr. Wood has been very adept at finding out where they might find small pockets of money to help cover those costs.
* Although team members are pleased that he is able to obtain the money, they are sure he will use this as just another example of how he was the one doing most the work on the project.

Questions
1. Bases on the skill approach, how would you assess Dr. Wood's leadership and his relationship to the members of the Elder Care Project team? Will the project be successful?
2. Does Dr. Wood have the skills necessary to be an effective leader of this research team?
3. The skills model describes three important competencies for leaders: problem-solving skills, social judgment skills, and knowledge. If you were to coach Dr. Wood using this model, what competencies would you address with him? What changes would you suggest that he make in his leadership?

## CASE 3.2: A Shift for Lieutenant Colonel Adams
* Lt. Col. John Adams was a n aeronautical engineer in the Air Force who was recognized as an accomplished officer; he rose quickly thorugh the ranks of lieutenant, captain, and major. In addition, he successfully completed a number of professional development courses in the Air Force and received a master's degree in engineering. In the earlier part of his service, his career assignment required overseeing 15- to 20-person shifts that were responsible for routine maintenance schedules for squadron and base aircraft. As he progressed in rank, he moved to engineering projects, which were supported by small technical staffs.
* Based on his strong performance, Major Adams was promoted to lieutenant colone. earlier than his peers. Instead of moving him into another engineering position, the personnel bureau and his assignment officer decided that Lieutenant Colonel Adam would benefit from a tour in which he could expand his professional background and experience. Consequently, he was assigned to Base X as the commanding officer of the administration branch. Base X was an airbase with approimately 5,000 military and civilian personnel.
* As the administration officer, Adams was the senior human resource officer and the principal advisor to teh base commander on all human resource issues. Adams and his staff of 135 civilian and military personnel were responsible for personnel issues, food services, recreation, family support, and medical services. In addition, Lieutenant Colonel Adams was assigned to chair the Labor-Management Relations Committee for the base.
* At the end of the Cold War, as part of the declared peace dividend, the government decided to reduce its defense budget. In February, barely 6 months after Adams took over command of the administration branch, the federal government announced a significant reduction in the size of the military and the closure of many bases. Base X was to be closed as an air base and reassigned to the Army. The closure was to take place within 1 year, and the base was to prepared for the arrival of the first Army troops in 2 years. As part of the reduction program, the federal government initiated voluntary retirement programs for civilian and military personnel. Those wanting to retire had until April 1 to decide.
* Orders for the conversion of the airbase included the following:

        * The base will continue normal operations for 6 months.
        * The squadrons--complete with aircrews, equipment, and families (1,000)--must be relocated to their new bases and operational by August 1.
        * The remaining base personnel sgtrength, both civillian and military, must be reduced by 30%
        * The base must continue to provide personnel for operational missions.
        * The reduction of personnel must be consistent with federal voluntary early-retirement programs.
        * The base must be prepared with a support structure to accept 2,000 new soldiers, expected to arrive in 2 years

* Adams was assigned t odevelop a human resource plan that would meet the imposed staff levels for the entire base while ensuring that the base was still able to perform the operational tasks it had been given. Faced with this daunting task, Adams conducted an extensive review of all of the relevant orders concerning the base transformation, and he familiarized himself with all of the rules concerning the early-retirement program. After a series of initial meetings with the other base branch chiefs, he laid out a plan that could be accomplished by the established deadlines. At the same time, he chaired a number of meetings with his own staff about how to meet the mandated reductions within his own branch.
* After considering the target figures for the early-retirement program, it was clear that the mandated numbers could not be reached. Simply allowing everyone who had applied for early retirement to leave was not considered an option because doing so would devastate entire sections of the base. More job cuts were required, and choices had to be made as to who would stay, why, and in what areas. Adams met stiff resistance in the meetings to determine what sections would bear the brunt of the additional cutbacks.
* Adams conducted his own independent analysis of his own branch before consulting with his staff. Based on his thorough examination of the data, he mandated further reductions in his sections. Specifically targeted were personnel in base housing, single-person accommodations, family services, and recreational sections. He also mandated a further 10% cut of military positions in his sections.
* After meeting the mandated reduction targets, Lieutenant Colonel Adams was informed that the federal government would accept all personnel who applied for early retirement, which was an unexpected decision. When superimposed on the already mandated reductions, this move caused critical shortages in key areas. Within weeks of implementation of the plan, the base commander was receiving mounting complaints from both civillian and military members over the implementation of the plan.
* Incidents of stress, frustration, and discontent rose dramatically. Families trying to move found support services cut back or nonexistent. The transition staff was forced to work evenings and weekends. Family support services were swamped and asking for additional help.
* Despite spending a large amount of overtime trying to address the diverse issues both basewide and within his branch. Adams found himself struggling to keep his head above water. To make matters worse, the base was having difficulty meeting its operational mission, and vital sections were critically understaffed. The base commander wanted answers. When pressed, Adams stated that his plan met all of the required deadlines and targets, and the plan conformed to all the guidelines of the early retuirement programs. "Maybe so", replied the base commander, "but you forgot about the bigger picture."

Questions
1. Based on the skill model, how would you assess Lt Col. John Adams's ability to meet the challenges of the base administration position?
2. How would you assess his ability to meet the additional tasks he faced regarding the conversion of the base?
3. If you were to coach Adams on how he could improve his leadership, what would you tell him?

## CASE 3.3: Andy's Recipe
* Andy Garafallo owns an Italian restaurant that sits in the middle of a cornfield near a large Midwestern city. On the restaurant's far wall is an elaborate mural of the canals of Venice. A gondola hangs on the opposite wall, up by the ceiling. Along another wall is a row of real potted lemon trees. "My ancestors are from Sicily", says Andy, "In fact, I can remember seeing my grandfather take a bit out of a lemon, just like the ones hanging on those trees".
* Andy is very confident about his approach to his restaurant, and he should be, because the restaurant is celebrating its 25th anniversary. "I'm darned sure of what I want to do. I'm not trying different fads to get people to come here. People come here because they know they will get great food. They also want to support someone with whom they can connect. This is my approach. Nothing more, nothing less". Although other restaurants have folded, Andy seems to have found a recipe for success.
* Since opening his restaurant, Andy had had a number of managers. Currently, he has three: Kelly, Danielle, and Patrick. Kelly is a kitchen (food prep) manager who is known as very honest and dependable. She loves her work, and is efficient, good with ordering, and good with preparation. Andy really likes Kelly but is frustrated with her because she has such difficulty getting along with the salespeople, delivery people, and waitstaff.
* Danielle, who works out front in the restaurant, has been with Andy the longest, 6 years. Danielle likes working at Garafallo's--she lives and breathes the place. She fully buys into Andy's approach of putting customers first. In fact, Andy says she has a knack for knowing what customers need even before they ask. Although she is very hospitable, Andy says she is lousy with numbers. She just doesn't seem to catch on to that side of the business.
* Patrick, who has been with Andy for 4 years, usually works out front but can work in the kitchen as well. Although Patrick has a strong work ethic and is great with numbers, he is weak on the people side. For some reason, Patrick treats customers as if they are faceless, coming across as very unemotional. In addition, Patrick tends to approach problems with an either-or perspective. This has gotten him into trouble on more than one occasion. Andy wishes that Patrick would learn to lighten up. "He's a good manager, but he needs to recognize that some things just aren't that important", says Andy.
* Andy's approach to his managers is that of a teacher and coach. He is always trying to help them improve. He sees part of his responsibility as teaching them every aspect of the restaurant business. **Andy's stated goal is that he wants his managers to be "A" players when they leave his business to take on jobs elsewhere.** Helping people to become the beest they can be is Andy's goal for his restaurant employees.
* Although Andy works 12 hours a day, he spends little time analyzing the numbers. He does not think about ways to improve his profit margin by cutting corners, raising an item price here, or cutting quality there. Andy says, "It's like this: The other night I got a call from someone who said they wanted to come in with a group and wondered if they could bring along a cake. I said 'yes' with one stipulation... I get a piece! Well the people came and spent a lot of money. Then they told me that they have actually wanted to go to another restaurant but the other place would not allow them to bring in  their own cake." Andy believes very strongly in his approach. "You get business by being what you should be". Compared with other restaurants, his restaurants is doing quite well. Although many places are happy to net 5%-7% profit, Andy's Italiant restaurant nets 30% profit, year in and year out.

Questions
1. What accounts for Andy's success in the restaurant business?
2. From a skills perspective, how would you describe the three managers, kelly, Danielle, and Patrick? What does each of them need to do to improve his or her skills?
3. How would you describe Andy's competencies? Does Andy's leadership suggest that one does not need all three skills in order to be effective?

## LEADERSHIP INSTRUMENT
* Many questionnaire assess an individual's skills for leadership. A quick search of the Internet provides a host of these questionnaires. Almost all of them are designed to be used in training and development to give people a feel for their leadership abilities. Surveys have been used for years to help people understand and improve their leadership style, but most questionnaires are not used in research because they have not been tested for reliability and validity. Neverthless, they are useful as self-help instruments because they provide specific information to people about their leadership skills.
* In this chapter, we present a comprehensive skills model that is based on many empirical studies of leader's skills. Although the questionnaires used in these studies are highly reliable and are valid instruments, they are not suitable for our more pragmatic disussion of leadership in this text. In essence they are too complex and involved. For example, Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, et al used measures that included open-ended responses and very sophisticated scoring procedures. Though critically important for validating the model, these complicated measures are less valuable as self-instruction questionnaires.
* A skills inventory is provided in the next section to assist you in understanding how leadership skills are measured and what your own skills might be. Your scores on the inventory will give you a sense of your own leadership competencies. You may be strong in all three skills, or you may be stronger in some skills than in others. The questionnaire will give you a sense of your own skills profile. If you are stronger in one skill and weaker in another, they may help you determine where you want to improve in the future..

# Chapter 4: Style Approach

## DESCRIPTION
* The style approach emphasizes the behavior of the leader. This distinguishes it from the trait approach (Chapter 2), which emphasizes the personality characteristics of the leader, and the skills approach (Chapter 3), which emphasizes the leader's capabilities. The style approach focuses exclusively on what leaders do and how they act. In shifting the study of leadership to leader style or behaviors, the style approach expanded the study of leadership to include the actions of leaders toward subordinates in various contexts.
* Researchers studying the style approach determined that leadership is composed of two general kinds of behaviors: task behaviors and relationship behaviors. Task behaviors facilitate goal accomplishment: They help group members to achieve their objectives. Relationship behaviors help subordinate feel comfortable with themselves, with each other, and with the situation in which they find themselves. The central purpose of the style approach is to explain how leaders combine these two kinds of behaviors to influence subordinates in their efforts to reach a goal.
* Many studies have been conducted to investigate the style approach. Some of the first studies to be done were conducted at The Ohio State University in the late 1940s, based on the findings of Stogdill's work, which pointed to the importance of considering more than leaders' traits in leadership research. At about the same time, another group of researchers at the University of Michigan was conducting a series of studies that explored how leadership functioned in small groups. A third line of research was begun by Blake and Mouton in the early 1960s; it explored how managers used task and relationship behaviors in the organizational setting.
* Although many research studies could be categorized under the heading of the style approach, the Ohio State studies, the Michigan studies, and the studies by Blake and Mounton are strongly representative of the ideas in this approach. By looking closely at each of these groups of studies, we can draw a clearer picture of the underpinnings and implications of the style approach.

## HOW DOES THE STYLE APPROACH WORK?
* Unlike many of the other approaches discussed in the book, the style approach is not a refined theory that provides a neatly organized set of prescriptions for effective leadership behavior. Rather, the style approach provides a framework for assessing leadership in a broad way, as behavior with a task and relationship dimension. The style approach works not by telling leaders how to behave, but by describing the major components of their behavior.
* The style approach reminds leaders that their actions toward others occur on a task level and a relationship level. In some situations, leaders need to be more task oriented, whereas in others they need to be more relationship oriented. Similarly, some subordinates need leaders who provide a lot of direction, whereas others need leaders who can show them a great deal of nurturance and support. The style approach gives the leader a way to look at his or her own behavior by subdividing it into two dimensions.
* An example may help explain how the style approach works. Imagine two college classrooms on the first day of class and two professors with entirely different styles. Professors Smith comes to class, introduces herself, takes attendance, goes over the syllabus, explains the first assignment, and dismisses the class. Professor Jones comes to class and, after introducing herself and handing out the syllabus, tries to help the students to get to know one another by having each of the students describe a little about themselves, their majors, and their favorite nonacademic activies. The leadership styles of professors Smith and Jones are quite different. The prespondence of what Professor Smith does could be labeled task behavior, and the majority of what Professor Jones does could be labeled relationship behavior. The style approach provides a way to inform the professors about the differences in their behaviors. Depending on the response of the students to their style, the professors may want to change their behavior to improve their teaching on the first day of class.
* Overall, the style approach offers a means of assessing in a general way the behaviors of leaders. It reminds leaders that their impact on others occurs through the tasks they perform as well as in the relationships they create.

## STRENGTHS
* The style approach makes several positive contributions to our understanding of the leadership process. First, the style approach marked a major shift in the general focus of leadership research. Before the inception of the style approach, researchers treated leadership exclusively as a personality trait. **The style approach broadened the scope of leadership research to include the behaviors of leaders and what they do in various situations.** No longer was the focus of leadership on the personal characteristics of leaders: It was expanded to include what leaders did and how they acted.
* Second, a wide range of studies on leadership style validates and gives credibility to the basic tenets of the approach. First formulated and reported by researchers from The Ohio State University and the University of Michigan, and subsequently reported in the works of Blake and Mouton and Blake and McCanse, the style approach is substantiated by a multitude of research studies that offer a viable approach to understanding the leadership process.
* Third, on a conceptual level, researchers from the style approach have ascertained that a leader's style consists primarily of two major types of behaviors: task and relationship. **The significance of this idea is not to be understated.** Whenever leadership occurs, the leader is acting out both task and relationship behaviors, the key to being an effective leader often rests on how the leader balances these two behaviors. Together they form the core of the leadership process.
* Fourth, the style approach is heuristic. It provides us with a broad conceptual map that is worthwhile to use in our attempts to understand the complexities of leadership. Leaders can learn a lot about themselves and how they come across to others by trying to see their behaviors in light of the task and relationship dimensions. Based on the style approach, leaders can assess their actions and determine how they may want to change to improve their leadership style.

## CRITICISMS
* Along with its strengths, the style approach also has several weaknesses. First, the research on styles has not adequately shown how leaders' styles are associated with performance outcomes. Researchers have not been able to establish a consistent link between task and relationship behaviors and outcomes such as morale, job satisfaction, and productivity. According to Yukl, the "result from this massive research effort have been mostly contradictory and inconclusive." He further pointed out that the only strong finding about leadership styles is that leaders who are considerate have followers who are more satisfied.
* Another criticism is that this approach has failed to finda universal style of leadership that could be effective in almost every situation. The overarching goal for researchers studying the style approach appeared to be the identification of a universal set of leadership behaviors that would consistenly result in effective outcomes. Because of inconsistencies in the research findings, this goal was never reached. Similarly to the trait approach, which was unable to identify the definitive personal characteristic of leaders, the style approach has been unable to identify the universal behaviors that are associated with effective leadership.
* A final criticism of the style approach is that it implies that the most effective leadership style is the high-high style (i.e., high task and high relationship). Although some researchers suggested that high-high managers are most effective, that may not be the case in all situations. In fact, the full range of research findings provides only limited support for a universal high-high style. Certain situations may require different leadership styles; some may be complex and require high-task behavior, and others may be simple and require supportive behavior. At this point in the development of research on the style approach, it remains unclear whether the high-high style is the best style of leadership.

## APPLICATION
* The style approach can be applied esily in ongoing leadership settings. At all levels in all types of organizations, managers are continually enaged in task and relationship behaviors. By assessing their own style, managers can determine how they are coming across to others and how they could change their behaviors to be more effective. **In essence, the style approach provide a mirror to managers that is helpful in answering the frequently asked question, "How am I doing as a leader?"**
* Many leadership training and development programs throughout the country are structured along the lines of the style approach. Almost all are designed similarly and include giving managers questionnaires that assess in some way their task and relationship behaviors toward subordinates. Participants use these assessments to improve their overall leadership styles.
* An example of a training and development program that deals exclusively with leader styles is **Blake and Mouton's Leadership Grid (formerly Managerial Grid) seminar**. Grid seminars are about increasing productivity, improving morale, and gaining employee commitment. They are offered by Grid International, and international organization development company. **At grid seminars, self-assessment, small-group experiences, and candid critiques allow managers to learn how to define effective leadership, how to manage for optimal results, and how to identify and change ineffective leadership behaviors. The conceptual framework around which the grid seminars are structured is the style approach to leadership.
* In short, the style approach applies to nearly everything a leader does. It is an approach that is used as a model by many training and development companies to teach managers how to improve their effectiveness and organizational productivity.

## CASE STUDIES
* In this section, you will find three case studies (Case 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3) that describe the leadership styles of three different managers, each of whom is working in a different organizational seeting. The first case is about a maintenance director in a large hospital, the second deals with a supervisor in a small sporting goods store, and the third is concerned with the director of marketing and communicatgion at college. At the end of each case are questions that will help you to analyze the case from the perspective of the style approach.

## CASE 4.1: A Drill Sergeant at First
* Mark Young is the head of the paining department in a large hospital; 20 union employees report to him. Before coming on borad at the hospital, he had worked as an independent contractor. At the hospital, he took a position that was newly created because the hospital believed change was needed in how painting services were provided.
* Upon beginning his job, Mark did a 4-month analysis of the direct and indirect costs of painting services. His findings supported the perceptions of his administrators that painting services were inefficient and costly. As a result, Mark completely reorganized the department, designed a new scheduling procedure, and redefined the expected standards of performance.
* Mark says that when he started out in his new job he was "all task", like a drill sergeant who didn't seek any input from his subordinates. From Mark's point of view, the hospital environment did not leave much room for errors, so he needed to be strict about getting painters to do a good job within the constraints of the hospital environment.
* As time went along, Mark relaxed his style and was less demanding. He delegated some responsibilities to two crew leaders who reported to him, but he always stayed in clsoe touch with each of the employees. On a weekly basis, Mark was known to take small groups of workers to the local sports bar for burgers on the house. He loved to banter with the employees and could take it as well as dish it out.
* Mark is very proud of his department. He says he always wanted to be a coach, and that's how he feels about running his deparment. He enjoys working with people; in particular, he says he likes to see the glint in their eyes when they realize that they've done a good job and they have done it on their own.
* Because of Mark's leadership, the painting department has improved substantially and is now seen by workers in other departments as the most productive department in hostpital maintenance. Painting services received a customer rating of 92%, which is the highest of any service in the hospital.

Questions
1. From the style perspective, how would you describe Mark's leadership?
2. How did his style change over time.
3. In general, do you think he is more task oriented or more relationship oriented.
4. What score do you think he would get on Blake and Mouton's grid?

## CASE 4.2: Eating Lunch Standing Up
* Susan Parks is the part-own and manager of Marathon Sports, an athletic equipment store that specializes in running shoes and accessories. The store employs about 10 people, most of whom are college students who work part-time during the week and full-time on weekends. Marathon Sports is the only store of its kind in a college town with a population of 125,000. The annual sales figures for the store have shown 15% growth each year.
* Susan has a lot invested in the store, and she works very hard to make sure the store continues to maintain its reputation and pattern of growth. She works 50 hours a week at the store, where she wears many hats, including those of buyer, scheduler, trainer, planner, and salesperson. There is never a moment when Susan is not doing something. Rumor has it that she eats her lunch standing up.
* Employees' reaction to Susan are strong and varied. Some people like her style, and others do not. Those who like her style talk about how organized and efficient the store is when she is in charge. Susan makes the tasks and goals for everyone very clear. She keeps everyone busy, when they go home at night, they feel as if they have accomplished something. They like to work for Susan because she knows what she is doing. Those who do not like her style complain that she is too driven. it seems that her sole purpose for being at the store is to get the job done. She seldom, if ever, takes a break or jsut hangs out with the staff. These people say Susan is pretty hard to relate to, and as a result it is not much fun working at Marathon Sports.
* Susan is beginning to sense that employees have a mixed reaction to her leadership style. This bothers her, but she does not know what to do about it. In addition to her work at the store, Susan struggles hard to be a good spouse and mother of three children.

Questions
1. According to the style approach, would you describe Susan's leadership?
2. Why does her leadership style create such a pronounced reaction from her subordinates?
3. Do you think she should change her style?
4. Would she be effective if she changed?

## CASE 4.3: We are Family
* Betsy Moore has been hired as the director of marketing and communications for a medium-size college in the Midwest. With a long history of success as a marketing and public relations professional, she was the unanimous choice of the hiring committee. Betsy is excited to be working for Marianne, the vice president of college advancement, who comes from a similar backgroun to Betsy's. In a meeting with Marianne, Betsy is told the college needs an aggressive plan to revamp and energize the school's marketing and communications efforts. Betsy and Marianne seem in perfect sync with the direction they believe is right for the college's program. marianne also explains that she has established a departmental culture of teamwork and empowerment and that she is a strong advocate of being a mentor to her subordinates rather than a manager.
* Betsy has four direct reports: two writers, Bridget and Suzanne, who are young women in their 20s; and Carol and Francine, graphic designers who are in their 50s. In her first month, Betsy puts together a meeting with her direct reports to develop a new communications plan for the college, presenting the desired goals to the team and asking for their ideas on initiatives and improvements to meet those goals. Bridets and Suzanne provide little in the way of suggested changes, with Bridget asking pointedly, "Why do we need to change anythin?"
* In her weekly meeting with the vice president, Betsy talks about the resistance to change she encountered from the team. Marianne nods, saying she heard some of the team members' concerns when she went to lunch with them earlier in the week. When Betsy looks surprised, Marianne gives her a knowing smile. "We are like a family here; we have close relationships outside of work. I go to lunch or the movies with Suzanne and Bridget at least once a week. But don't worry; I am only a sounding board for them, and encourage them to come to you to resolve their issues. They know you are their boss."
* But they don't come to Betsy. Soon Bridget stops coming to work at 8 a.m., showing up at 10 a.m. daily. As a result, she misses the weekly planning meetings. When Betsy approaches her about it, Bridget tells her, "It's OK with Marianne; she says as long as I am using the time to exercise and improve my health she supports it".
* Betsy meets with Suanne to implement some changes to Suzanne's pet project, the internal newsletter. Suzanne gets blustery and tearful, accusing Betsy of insulting her work. Later, Betsy watches Suzanne and Marianne leave the office together for lunch. A few hours later, Marianne comes into Betsy's office and tell her, "Go easy on the newsletter changes. Suzanne is an insecure person, and she is feeling criticized and put down by you right now."
* Betsy's relationship with the other two staff members is better. Neither seems to have teh close contact with Marianne that the younger team members have. They seem enthusiastic and supportive of the new direction Betsy wants to take the program in.
* As the week go by, Marianne begins having regular "Mentor Meeting" with Bridget and Suzanne, going to lunch with both women at least twice a week. After watching the three walk out together one day, Francine asks Betsy if it troubles her. Betsy replies, as calmly as she can, "it is part of Marianne's mentoring program."
* Francine rolls her eyes and says, "Marianne's not mentoring anyone; she just wants someone to go to lunch with every day."
* After 4 months on the job, Betsy goes to Marianne and outlines the challenges that the vice president's close relationship with Bridget and Suzanne have presented to the progress of the marketing and communications program. She asks her directly, "Please stop".
* Marianne gives her the knowing, motherly smile again, "I see a lot of potential in Bridget, and Suzanne and want to help foster that," she explains, "They are still young in their careers, and my relationship with them is important because I can provide the mentoring and guidance to develop their abilities."
* "But it's creating problems between them and me," Betsy points out, "I acn't manage them if they can circumvent me every time they disagree with me. We aren't getting any work done. You and I have to be on the same team."
* Marianne shakes her head. "The problem is that we have very different leadership styles. I like to empower people, and you like to boss them around."

Questions
1. Marianne and Betsy do indeed have different leadership styles. What style would you ascribe to Betsy? To Marianne?
2. Does Betsy need to change her leadership style to improve the situation with Bridget and Suzanne? Does Marianne need to change her style of leadership?
3. How can Marianne and Betsy work together

# Chapter 5: Situational Approach

## Description
* One of the more widely recognized approaches to leadership is the situational approach, which was developed by Hersey and Blanchard based on Reddin's 3-D management style theory. The situational approach has been refined and revised several times since its inception, and it has been used extensively in organizational leadership training and development.
* As the name of the approach implies, situational leadership focuses on leadership in situations. The premise of the theory is that different situations demand different kinds of leadership. From this perspective, to be an effective leader requires that a person adapt his or her style to the demands of different situations.
* Situational leadership stresses that leadership is composed of both a directive and a supportive dimension, and that each has to be applied appropriately in a given situation. To determine what is needed in a particular situation. To determine what is needed in a particular situation, a leader must evaluate her or his employees and assess how competent and committed they are to perform a given task. Based on the assumption that employees' skills and motivation vary over time, situational leadership suggests that leaders should change the degree to which they are directive or supportive to meet the changing needs of subordinates.
* In brief, the essence of situational leadership demands that leaders match their style to the competence and commitment of the subordinates. Effective leaders are those who can recognize what employees need and then adapt their own style to meet those needs.
* The situational approach is illustrated in the model developed by Blanchard and Blanchard et al., called the Situational Leadership II (SLII) model. The model is an extension and refinement of the original situational leadership model developed by Hersey and Blanchard.
* The dynamics of situational leadership are best understood when we separate the SLII model into two parts: leadership style and development level of subordinates.

### Leadership Styles
* Leadership style consists of the behavior pattern of a person who attempts to influence others. It includes both directive (task) behavior and supportive (relationship) behaviors. Directive behaviors help group members accomplish goals by giving directions, establishing goals and methods of evaluation, setting time lines, defining roles, and showing how the goals are to be achieved. **Directive behavior clarify, often with one-way communication, what is to be done, how it is to be done, and who is responsible for doing it.** Supportive behaviors help group members feel comfortable about themselves, their coworkers, and the situation. Supportive behaviors involve two-way communication and responses that show social and emotional support to others. Examples of supportive behaviors include asking for input, solving problems, praising, sharing information about oneself, and listening. Supportive behaviors are mostly job related.
* Leadership styles can be classified further into four distinct categories of directive and supportive behaviors. The first style is a high directive-low supportive style, which is also called a directing style. In this approach, the leader focuses communication on goal achievement, and spends a smaller amount of time using supportive behaviors. using this style, a leader gives instructions about what and how goals are to be achieved by the subordinates and then supervises them carefully.
* The second style (S2) is called a coaching approach and is a high directive-high supportive style. In this approach, the leader focuses communication on both achieving goals and meeting subordinates' socioemotional needs. **The coaching style requires that the leader involve himself or herself with suborindates by giving encouragement and soliciting suborindate input. However, coaching is an extension of S1 in that it still requires that the leader make the final decision on the what and how of goal accomplishment.**
* Style 3 (S3) is a supporting approach that requires that the leader take a high supportive-low directive style. In this approach, the leader does not focus exclusively on goals but uses supportive behaviors that bring out the employees' skills around the task to be accomplished. The supportive style incudes listening, praising, asking for input, and giving feedback. A leader using this style gives subordinates control of day-to-day decision but remain available to facilitate problem solving. An S3 leader is quick to give recognition and social support to subordinates.
* Last, S4 is called the low supportive-low directive style, or a delegating approach. In this approach, the leader offers less task input and social support, facilitating employees' confidence and motivation in reference to the task. the delegative leader lessens involvement in planning, control of details, and goal classification. After the group agrees on what it is to do, this style lets subordinates take responsibility for getting the job done the way they see fit. A leader using S4 gives control to subordinates and refrains from intervening with unnecessary social support.
* The SLII model illustrates how directive and supportive leadership behaviors combine for each of the four different leadership styles. As shown by the arrows on the bottom and left side of the model, directive behaviors are high in the S1 and S2 quadrants and low in S3 and S4, whereas supportive behaviors are high in S2 and S3 and low in S1 and S4.

### Development Levels
* A second major part of the situational leadership model concerns the development level of subordinates. Development level is the degree to which subordinates have the competence and commitment necessary to accomplish a given task or activity. Stated another way, it indicates whether a person has mastered the skills to do a specific task and whether a person has developed a positive attitude regarding the task. Employees are at a high development level if they are interested and confident in their work and know how to do the task. Employees are at a low development level if they have little skill for the task at hand but believe that they have the motivation or confidence to get the job done.
* The levels of development are illustrated in the lower portion of the diagram in Figure 5.1. The levels describe various combinations of commitment and competence for employees on a given task. They are intended to be task specific and are not intended to be used for the purpose of labeling followers.
* On a particular task, employees can be classified into four categories: D1, D2, D3, and D4, from low development to high development. Specifically, D1 employees are low in competence and high in commitment. They are new to a task and do not know exactly how to do it, but they are excited about the challenge of it. D2 employees are described as having some competence but low commitment. They have started to learn a job, but they also have lost some of their initial motivation about the job. D3 represents employees who have moderate to high competence but may lack commitment. they have essentially developed the skills for the job, but they are uncertain as to whether they can accomplish the task by themselves. Finally, D4 employees are the highest in development, having both a high degree of competence and a high degree of commitment to getting the job done. They have the skills to do the job and the motivation to get it done.

## HOW DOES THE SITUATIONAL APPROACH WORK?
* The situational approach is constructed around the idea that employees move forward and backward along the developmental continuum, which represents the relative competence and commitment of subordinates. For leaders to be effective, it is essential that they determine where subordinates are on the developmental continuum and adapt their leadership styles so they directly match their style to that development level.
* In a given situation, the first task for a leader is to determine the nature of the situation. Questions such as the following must be addressed: **What task are subordinates being asked to perform? How complex is the task? Are the subordinates sufficiently skilled to accomplished the task? Do they have the desire to complete the job once they start it? Answers to these questions will help leaders to identify correctly the specific developmental level at which their subordinates are functioning.** For example, new employees who are very excited but lack understanding of job requirements would be identified as D1-level employees. Conversely, seasoned workers with proven abilities nd great devotion to a company would be identified as functioning at the D4 level.
* Having identified the correct development level, the second task for the leader is to adapt his or her style to the prescribed leadership style represented in the SLII model. There is a one-to-one relationship between the development level of subordinates (D1, D2, etc.) and the leader's style (S1, S3, etc.) For example, if subordinates are at the first level of development, D1, the leader needs to adopt a high-directive and low-supportive leadership style (S1, or directing). If subordinates are more advanced and at the second development level, D2, the leader needs to adopt a high directive-high supportive leadership style (S2, coaching,). For each level of development, there is a specificc style of leadership that the leader should adopt.
* An example of this would be Rene Martinez, who owns a house painting business. Rene specializes in restoration of old homes and over 30 years has acquired extensive knowledge of the specialized abilities required including understanding old construction and painting materials and t echniques, plaster repair, carpentry, and window glazing. Rene has three employees: Ashley, who has worked for him for seven years and whom he trained from the beginning of her career; Levi, who worked for a commercial painter for four years before being hired by Rene two years ago; and Anton, who is just starting out.
* Because of Ashley's years of experience and training. Rene would classify her as a D3 employee. She is very competent, but still seeks Rene's insight on some tasks. She is completely comfortable prepping surfaces for painting and directing the others, but has some reluctence to taking on jobs that involve carpentry. Depending on the work he assigns Ashley, Rene moves between S3 (supporting) and S4 (delegating) leadership behaviors.
* When it comes to painting, Levi is a D4 needing little direction or support from Rene. But Levi has to be trained in many other aspects of home restoration, making him a D1 or D2 in those skills. Levi is a quick learner, and Rene finds he only needs to be shown or tol how to do something once before he is able to complete it easily. In most situations, Rene uses an S2 (coaching) leadership behavior with Levi. If the task is more complicated and requires detailed training, Rene moves back into the S1 (directing) behavior with Levi.
* Anton is completely new to this field, coming in at the D1 level of development. What he lacks in experience he more than makes up for in energy. He is always willing to jump in and do whatever he's asked to do. He is not as careful as he needs to be, however, often neglecting the proper prepping techniques and cleanup about which Rene is a stickler. Rene finds that not only he, but also Ashley, uses an S1 (directing) behavior with Anton. Because Levi is also fairly new, he finds it difficult to be directive with Anton, but likes to give him help when he seems unsure of himself, falling in to the S3 (supporting) behavior.
* This example illustrates how subordinates can move back and forth along the development continuum, requiring leaders to be flexible in their leadership behavior. Subordinates may move from one development level to another rather quickly over a short period (e.g., a day or a week), or more slowly on tasks that proceed over much longer periods of time (e.g., a month). Leaders can not use the same style in all contexts; rather, they need to adapt their style to subordinates and their unique situations. Unlike the trait and contingency approaches, which advocate a fixed style for leaders, the situational approach demands that leaders demonstrate a high degree of flexibility.

## STRENGTHS
* The situational approach to leadership has several strengths, particularly for practioners. The first strength is that it has stood the test of time in the marketplace. Situational leadership is well known and frequently used for training leaders within organizations. Hersey and Blanchard reported that it has been a factor in training programs of more than 400 of the Fortune 500 companies. It is perceived by corporations as offering a credible model for training people to become effective leaders.
* A second strength of situational leadership is its practicality. Situational leadership is easy to understand, intuitively sensible, and easily applied in a variety of settings. Whereas some leadership approaches provide complex and sophisticated ways to assess your own leadership behavior (e.g., the decision-making approach in Vroom & Yetton, 1973), situational leadership provides a straightforward approach that is easily used. Because it is described at an abstract level that is easily grasped, the ideas behind the approach are quickly acquired. In addition, the principles suggested by situational leadership are easy to apply across a variety of settings, including work, school, and family.
* Closely akin to the strength of practicality is a third strength of situational leadership: its prescriptive value. Whereas many theories of leadership are descriptigve in nature, the situational approaches is prescriptive. It tells you what you should and show not do in various contexts. For example, if your subordinates are very low in competence, situational leadership prescribes a directing style for you as the leader. On the other hand, if your employees appear to be competent but lack confidence, the situational approach suggests that you lead with a supporting style. These prescriptions provide leaders with a valuable set of guidelines that can facilitate and enhance leadership.
* A fourth strength of situational leadership is that it emphasizes leader flexibility. Situational leadership stresses that leaders need to find out about their subordinates' needs and then adapt their leadership style accordingly. Leaders can not lead using a single style: They must be willing to change their style to meet the requirements of the situation. Situational leadership recognizes that employees act differently when doing different task. Effective leaders are those who can change their own style based on the task requirements and the subordinates' needs, even in the middle of a project.
* Finally, situational leadership reminds us to treat each subordinate differently based on the task at hand and to seek opportunities to help subordinates learn new skills and become more confident in their work. Overall, this approach underscores that subordinates have unique needs and deserve our help in trying to become better at doing their work.

## CRITICISMS
* Despite its extensive use in leadership training and development, situational leadership does have some limitations. The following criticisms point out several weakness in situational leadership and help to provide a more balanced picture of the general utility of this approach in studying and practice leadership.
* The first criticism of situational leadership is that only a few research studies have been conducted to justify the assumptions and propositions set forth by the approach. Although many doctoral dissertations address dimensions of situational leadership, most of these research studies have not been published. The lack of a strong body of research on situational leadership raises questions about the theoretical basis of the approach. Can we be sure it is a valid approach? It it certain that this approach does indeed improve performance? Does this approach compare favorably with other leadership approaches in its impact on subordinates? It is difficult to give firm answers to these questions when the testing of this approach has not resulted in a significant amount of published research findings.
* A second criticism that can be directed at situational leadership concerns the ambiguous conceptualization in the model of subordinates' development levels. The authors of the model do not make clear how commitment is combined with competence to form four distinct levels of development. In one of the earliest versions of the model, Hersey and Blanchard defined the four levels of commitment (matuirty) at unwilling and unable (Level 1), willing and unable (Level 2), unwilling and able (Level 3), and willing and able (Level 4). In a more recent version, represented by the SLII model, development level is described as high commitment and low competence in D1, low commitment and some competence in D2, variable commitment and high competence in D3, and high commitment and high competence in D4.
* The authors of situational leadership do not explain the theoretical basis for these changes in the compositions of each of the development levels. Furthermore, they do not explain how competence and commitment are weighted across different development levels. As pointed out by Blanchard et al., there is a need for further research to establish how competence and commitment are conceptualized for each development level. Closely related to the general criticism of ambiguity about subordinates' development levels is a concern with how commitment itself is conceptualized in the model. For example, Graeff suggested the conceptualization is very unclear. Blanchard et al. stated that subordinates' commitment is composed of confidence and motivation, but it is not clear how confidence and motivation combine to define commitment. According to the SLII model, commitment starts out high in D1, moves down in D2, becomes variable in D3, and rises again in D4. Intuitively, it appears mroe logical to describe subordinate commitment as existing on a continuum from low to moderate to high.
* The argument provided by Blanchard for how commitment varies in the SLII model is that subordinates usually start out motivated and eager to learn, and then they may become discouraged and disillusioned. Next, they may begin to lack confidence or motivation, or both, or last they become highly confident and motivated. But why is this so? Why do subordinates who learn a task become less committed? Why is there a decrease in commitment at Development Level 2 and 3? Without research findings to substantiate the way subordinate commitment is conceptualized, this dimension of situational leadership remain unclear.
* A fourth criticism of situational leadership has to do with how the model matches leader style with subordinate development levels--the prescriptions of the model. To determine the validity of the prescription suggested by the Hersey and Blanchard approach, Vecchio conducted a study of more than 300 high school teachers and their principals. He found that newly hired teachers were more satisfied and performed better under principals who had highly structured leadership styles, but that the performance of more experienced and mature teachers was unrelated to the style their principals exhibited.
* Vecchio and his colleagues have replicated this study twice: First in 1997, using university employees, and most recently in 2006, studying more than 800 U.S. Military Academy cadets. Both studies failed to find strong evidence to support the basic prescriptions suggested in the situational leadership model.
* A fifth criticism of situational leadership is that it fails to account for how certain demographic characteristics (e.g., education, experience, age, and gender) influence the leader-subordinate prescriptions of the model. For example, a study conducted by Vecchio and Boatwright showed that level of education and job experience were inversely related to directive leadership and were not related to supportive leadership. In other words, employees with more education and more work experience desired less structure. An interesting finding is that age was positively related to desire for structure: The older employees desired more structure than the younger employees did. In addition, their findings indicated that female and male employees had different preferences for styles of leadership. Female employees expressed a stronger preference for supportive leadership, whereas male employees had a strong desire for directive leadership. These findings indicate that demographic characteristics may affect employee's preferences for a particular leadership style. However, these characteristics are not considered in the situational model.
* Situational leadership can also be criticized from a practical standpoint because it does not fully address the issue of one-to-one versus group leadership in an organizational setting. For example, should a leader with a group of 20 employees lead by matching her or his style to the overall development of the group or to the development level of individual members of the group? Carew, Parisi-Carew, and Blanchard suggested that groups go through development stages that are similar to individuals', and that therefore leaders should try to match their styles to the group's development level. However, if the leader matches her or his style to the mean development level of a group, how will this affect the individual whose development levels are quite different from those of their colleagues? Existing research on situational leadership does not answer this question. More research is needed to explain how leaders can adapt their styles simultaneously to the development levels of individual group members and to the group as a whole.
* A final criticism of situational leadership can be directed at the leadership questionnaires that accompany the model. Questionnaires on situational leadership typically ask respondents to analyze various work situations and select the best leadership style for each situation. The quesionnaires are constructed to force respondents to describe leadership style in terms of the specific parameters of situational leadership (i.e., directing, coaching, supporting, and delegating) rather than in terms of other leadership behaviors. Because the best answers available to respondents have been predetermined, the questionnaires are biased in favor of situational leadership.

## APPLICATION
* As we discussed earlier in this chapter, situational leadership is used in consulting because it is an approach that is easy to conceptualize and apply. The straightforward nature of situational leadership makes it practical for managers to use.
* The principles of this approach can be applied at many different levels in an organization. They can apply to how a chief executive officer (CEO) of a large corporation works with a board of directors, and they can also apply to how a crew chief in an assembly plant leads a small group of production workers. Middle managers can use situational leadership to direct staff meetings, and heads of departments can use this approach in planning structural changes within an organization. There is no shortage of opportunities for using situational leadership.
* Situational leadership applies during the initial stages of a project, when idea formation is important, and during the various subsequent phases of a project, when implementation issues are important. The fluid nature of situational leadership makes it ideal for applying to subordinates as they move forward or go backward (regress) on various projects. Because situatioanl leadership stresses adapting to followers, it is ideal for use with followers whose commitment and competence change over the course of a project.
* Given the breadth of the situational approach, it is applicable in almost any type of organization, at any level, for nearly all types of tasks. It is an encompassing model with a wide range of applications.

## CASE STUDIES
* To see how situational leadership can be applied in different organizational settings, you may want to assess Case 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3. For each of these cases, ask yourself what you would do if you found yourself in a similar situation. At the end of each case, there are questions that will help you analyze the context from the perspective of situational leadership.

#### CASE 5.1: What Style Do I Use?
* Bruce Cannon is the owner of a 5-year-old small plastics company that employs about 20 people. The company consists of three areas: engineering, sales, and production. For each of these areas, there is a single manager.
* Rick Nakano heads the engineering crew. He is a seasoned engineer and is the oldest employee in the company (he is 55 years old). Rick was hired because of his engineering ability and experience.
* Before joining the company, Rick worked for 20 years as an engineer for Ford Motor Company. His coworkers perceive him as very competent, even-tempered, and interested in the company.
* Rick has been spending most of his time in recent weeks on development a long-range plan for the company. His goal is to develop a creative model for making decisions about future expenditures for materials, equipment, plant development, and personnel. Ricky feel good about the way upper management has reacted to the first drafts of his plans.
* Beth Edwards heads t he sales force, which is the smallest unit in the company. Beth is the most recent hire in the company and has 15 years of sales experience in a different product area. Beth's peers see her as highly motivated but not too knowledgeable about the company's products. Beth's goal is to increase the company's annual sales by 30%. However, the first quarter sales figures indicate the rate of growth to be only 2%.
* Although Beth has been upbeat since the day she arrived. In recent weeks there have been problems in her department. Her sales staff talks about how little she knows about the plastic industry. In discussions about new products, Beth often is confused. In addition, she has difficulty describing the company's capabilities to customers because she does not understand fully how plastic company of this type functions.
* Steve Lynch is the manger of production and has been with the comapny since its inception. Steve started with the company just out of high school, working on the line, and move up in the comapny as a result of his hard work. His goal is to streamline production and decrease costs by 10%. He knows production backward and forward but is a bit apprehensive about his new role as production manager. In fact, Steve is afraid he might fall as manager. He does not know whether he is ready to have others depend on him when he has always been the one depending on others. The owner, Bruce, has great faith in Steve and has had several meetings with him to clarify his role and reassure him that he can do the work. He is certain that Steve will be an outstanding production manager.
* Bruce meets weekly with each of his managers to talk about how their groups are fitting in with the overall company goals. In his upcoming weekly conference, he wants to discuss with them what new procedures they could implement within their departments to improve their long-term performance. Bruce is wondering how he should approach each of his managers.

Questions
1. According to the basic assumptions of situational leadership, where would you place the three managers in regard to levels of development in the SLII model?
2. If you were Bruce, would you act the same toward each of the three managers?
3. Which conference would be the hardest for you, and which would be the easiest? Why?

#### CASE 5.2: Why Aren't They Listening?
* Jim Anderson is a training specialist in the human resource department of a large pharmaceutical company. In response to a recent companywide survey, Jim specially designed a 6-week training program on listening and communication skills to encourage effective management in the company. Jim's goals for the seminar are twofold: for participants to learn new communication behaviors and for participants to enjoy the seminar so they will want to attend future seminars.
* The first group to be offered the program was middle-level managers in research and development. This group consisted of about 25 people, nearly all of whom had advanced degrees. Most of this group had attended several in-house training programs in the past, so they had a sense of how the seminar would be designed and run. Because the previous seiminars had not always been very productive, many of the managers felt a little disillusioned about coming to the seminar. As one of the managers said, "Here we go again: a fancy in-house training program from which we will gain nothing."
* Because Jim recognized that the managers were very experienced, he did not put many restrictions on attendance and participation. He used a variety of presentation methods and actively solicited involvement from the managers in the seminar. Throughout the first two sessions, he went out of his way to be friendly with the group. He gave them frequent coffee breaks during the sessions; during these breaks, he promoted socializing and networking.
* During the third session, Jim became aware of some difficulties with the seminar. Rather than the full complement fo 25 managers, attendance had dropped to about only 15 managers. Although the starting time was established at 8:30, attendance had been arriving as late as 10:00. During the afternoon session, some of the managers were leaving the sesions to return to their offices at the company.
* As he approached the fourth session, Jim was apprehensive about why things had been going poorly. He had become quite uncertain about how he should approach the group. Many questions were running through his mind: Had he treated the managers in the wrong way? had he been too easy regarding attendance as the sessions? Should he have said something about the managers skipping out in the afternoon? Were the participants taking the seminar seriously? Jim was certain that the content of the seminar was innovative and substantive, but he could not figure out what he could change to make the program more successful. He sensed that his style was not working for this group, but he didn't have a clue as to how he should change what he was doing to make the sessions better.

Questions
1. According to the SLII model, what style of leadership is Jim using to run the seminars?
2. At what level are the managers?
3. From a leadership perspective, what is Jim doing wrong?
4. What specific changes could Jim implement to improve the seminar?

#### CASE 5.3: Getting the Message Across
* Ann Caldera is the program director of a college campus radio station (WCBA) that is supposed by the university. WCBA has a long history and is viewed favorably by students, faculty, the board of trustees, and the people in the community.
* Ann does not have a problem getting students to work at WCBA. In fact, it is one of the most sought-after university-related activities. The few students who are accepted to work at WCBA are always highly motivated because they value the opportunities to get hands-on media experience. In addition, those who are accepted tend to be highly confident (sometimes naively so) of their own radio ability. Despite their eagerness, most of them lack a fully understanding of the legal responsibilities of being on the air.
* One of the biggest problems that confronts Ann semester is how to train new students to follow the rules and procedures of WCBA when they are doing on-air announcing for news, sports, music, and other radio programs. It seems as if every semester numerous incidents arise in which an announcer violates in no small way the FCC rules for appropriate airtime communication. For example, rumor has it that one year a first-year student disc jocket on the evening shift announced that a new band was playing in town, the cover was $10, and everyone should go to hear the group. Making an announcement such as this is a clear violation of FCC rules: It is illegal.
* Ann is frustrated with her predicament but can not seem to figure out why it keeps occuring. She puts a lot of time and effort into helping new DJs, but they just do not seem to get the message that working at WCBA is a serious job that obeying the FCC rules is an absolute necessity. Ann wonders whether her leadership style is missing the mark.
* Each semester, Ann gives the students a very complete handout on policies and procedures. In addition, she tries to get to know each of the new students personally. Because she wants everybody to be happy WCBA, she tries very hard to build a relational climate at the station. Repeatly, students that Ann is the nicest advisor on campus. Because she recognizes the quality of her students, Ann mostly lets them do what they want at the station.

Questions
1. What's the problem at WCBA?
2. Using SLII as a basis, what would you advise Ann to do differently at the station?
3. Based on situational leadership, what creative schemes could Ann use t o reduce FCC infractions at WCBA?

## LEADERSHIP INSTRUMENT
* Although different versions of instruments have been developed to measure situational leadership, nearly all of them are constructed similarly. As a rule, the questionnaires provide 12 to 20 work-related situations and ask respondents to select their preferred style for each situation from four alternatives. The situations and styles are written to directly represent the leadership styles of the four quadrants in the model. Questionnaire responses are scored to give respondents information about their primary and secondary leadership styles, their flexibility, and their leadership effectiveness.
* The brief questionnaire provided in this section illustrates how leadership style is measured in questionnaires of situational leadership. For each situation on the questionnaire, you have to identify the development level of employees in the situation and then select one of the four response alternatives that indicate the style of leadership you would use in that situation.
* Expanded version of the brief questionnaire give respondents an overall profile of their leadership style. By analyzing the alternatives a respondent makes on the questionnaire, one can determine that respondent's primary and secondary leadership styles. By analyzing the range of choices a respondent makes, one can determine that respondent's leadership flexibility. Leadership effectiveness and diagnostic ability can be measured by analyzing the number of times the respondent made accurate assessments of a preferred leadership style.
* In addition to these self-scored questionnaires, situational leadership uses similar forms to tap the concurrent perceptions that bosses, associates, and followers have of a person's leadership style. These questionnaires give respondents a wide range of feedback on their leadership styles and the opportunity to compare their own views of leadership with the way others view them in a leadership role.

#### Situational Leadership

Situation 1
* Because of budget restrictions imposed on your department, it is necessary to consolidate. You are thinking of asking a highly capable and experienced member of your department to take charge of the consolidation. This person has worked in all areas of your department and has the trust and respect of most of the staff. She is very willing to help with the consolidation.

* A. Assign the project to her and let her determine how to accomplish it.
* B. Assign the task to her, indicate to her precisely what must be done, and supervise her work closely.
* C. Assign the task to her and provide support and encouragement as needed.
* D. Assign the task to her and indicate to her precisely what needs to be done but make sure you incorporate her suggestions

Development level _____ Action ______

Situation 2
* You have recently been made a department head of the new regional office. In getting to know your department staff, you have noticed that one of your inexperienced employees is not following through on assigned tasks. She is enthusiatic about her new job and wants to get ahead in the organization.

* A. Discuss the lack of follow-through with her and explore the alternative ways this problem can be solved.
* B. Specify what she must do to complete the tasks but incorporate any suggestions she may have.
* C. Define the steps necessary for her to complete the assigned tasks and monitor her performance frequently.
* D. Let her know about the lack of follow-through and give her more time to improve her performance

Development level _____ Action ________

Situation 3
* Because of a new and very important unit project, for the past 3 months you have made sure that your staff members understood their responsibilities and expected level of performance, and you have supervised them closely. Due to some recent project setbacks, your staff members have become somewhat discouraged. Their morale has dropped, and so has their performance.

* A. Continue to direct and closely supervise their performance.
* B. Give the group members more time to overcome the setbacks but occasionally check their progress
* C. Continue to define group activities but involve the group members more in decision making and incorporate their ideas.
* D. Participate in their problem-solving activities and encourage and support their efforts to overcome the project setbacks

Situation 4
* As a director of the sales department, you have asked a member of your staff to take charge of a new sales campaign. You have worked with this person on other sales campaigns, and you know he has the job knowledge and experience to be successful at new assignments. However, he seems a little unsure about his ability to do the job.

* A. Assign the new sales campaign to him and let let him function on his own
* B. Set goals and objectives for this new assignment but consider his suggestions and involve him in decision making
* C. Listen to his concerns but assure him he can do the job and support his efforts.
* D. Tell him exactly what the new campaign involves and what you expect of him, and supervise his performance closely.

####
* A short discussion of the correct answers to the brief questionnaire will help to explain the nature of situational leadership questionnaires.
* Situation I is the brief questionnaire describes a common problem faced by organizations during downsizing: the need to consolidate. In this particular situation, the leader has identified a person to direct the downsizing project who appears to be highly competent, experienced, and motivated. According to the SLII model, this person is at Developmental Level 4, which calls for a delegative approach. Of the four response alternatives, it is the A) response, "Assign the project to her and let her determine how to accomplish it," that best represents delegating (S4): low supportive-low directive leadership.
* Situation 2 describes a problem familiar to leaders at all levels in nearly all organizations: lack of follow-through by an enthusiatic employee. In the given example, the employee falls in Developmental Level 1 because she lacks the experience to do the job even though she is highly motivated to succeed. The SLII approach prescribes directing (SI) leadership for this type of employee. She needs to be told when and how to do her specific job. After she is given directions, her performance should be supervise closely. The correct response is C), "Define the steps necessary to complete the assign tasks and monitor her performance frequently"
* Situation 3 describes a very different circumstance. In this situation, the employees seem to have developed some experience and an understanding of what is required of them, but they have lost some of their motivation to complete the task. Their performance and commitment have stalled because of recent setbacks, even though the leader has been directing them closely. According to SLII, the correct response for the leader is the shift to a more supportive coaching style (S2) of leadership. The action response that reflects coaching is C), "Continue to define group activities but involve the group members more in decision making and incorporate their ideas."
* Situation 4 describes some of the concerns that arise for a director attempting to identifying the correct person to head a new sales campaign. The person identified for the position obviously has the skills necessary to do a good job with the new sales campaign, but he appears apprehensive about his his own abilities. In this context, SLII suggests that the director should use a supportive style (S3), which is consistent with leading employees who are competent but lacking a certain degree of confidence. A supportive style is represented by action response C), "Listen to his concerns but assure him he can do the job and support his efforts"
* Now select two employees. Diagnose their current development level on three different tasks and your style of leadership in each situation. Is there a match? If not, what specifically can you do for them as a leader to ensure that they have what they need to succeed?


# Chapter 6: Contingency Theory

## DESCRIPTION
* Although several approaches to leadership could be called contingency theories, the most widely recognized is Fiedler's. Contingency theory is a leader-match theory, which means it tries to match leaders to appropriate situations. It is called contingency because it suggests that a leader's effectiveness depends on how well the leader's style fits the context. To understand the performance of leaders, it is essential to understand the situations in which they lead. Effective leadership is contingent on matching a leader's style to the right setting.
* Fiedler developed contingency theory by studying the styles of many different leaders who worked in different contexts, primarily military organizations. he assessed leaders' styles, the situations in which they worked, and whether they were effective. After analyzing the styles of hundreds of leaders who were both good and bad, Fiedler and his colleagues were able to make empirically grounded generationalizations about which styles of leadership were best and which styles were worst for a given organizational context.
* In short, contingency theory is concerned with styles and situations. it provides the framework for effectively matching the leader and situation.

#### Leadership Styles
* Within the framework of contingency theory, leadership styles are described as task motivated or relationship motivated. Task-motivated leaders are concerned primarily with reaching goal, whereas relationship-motivated leaders are concerned with developing close interpersonal relationships. To measure leader styles, Fiedler developed the Least Preferred Coworker (LPC) scale. Leaders who score high on this scale are described as relationship motivated, and those who score low on the scale are identified as task motivated.

#### Situational Variables
* Contingency theory suggests that situations can be characterized in terms of three factors: leader-member relations, task structure, and position power. Leader-member relations consist of the group atmosphere and the degree of confidence, loyalty, and attraction that followers feel for their leader. If group atmosphere is positive and subordinates trust, like, and get along with their leader, the leader-member relations are defined as good. On the other hand, if the atmosphere is unfriendly and friction exists within the group, the leader-member relations are defined as poor.
* The second situational variable, task structure, is the degree to which the requirements of a task are clear and spelled out. Tasks that are completely structured tend to give more control to the leader, whereas vague and unclear tasks lessen the leader's control and influence. A task is considered structured when a) the requirements of the task are clearly stated and known by the people required to perform them, b) the path to accomplishing the task has few alternatives, c) completion of the task can be clearly demonstrated, and d) only a limited number of correct solution to the task exist. An example of a highly structured task is cleaning the milkshake machine at McDonald's. The rules for doing it are clearly stated to the employees, there is only one way to do it, whether it has been done can be verified, and whether it has been done correctly can also be determined easily. An example of a highly unstructured task is the task of running a fundraiser for a local volunteer organization. Running a fundraiser does not have a clear set of rules to follow, there are many alternative ways of doing it, one can not verify the corrections of the way it has been done, and no single best way exists to do it.
* Position power, the third characteristic of situations, is the amount of authority a leader has to reward or to punish followers. It includes the legitimate power individuals acquire as a result of the position they hold in an organization. Position power is strong if a person has the authority to hire and fire or give raises in rank or pay; it is weak if a person does not have the authority to do these things.
* Together, these three situational factors determine the favorableness of various situations in organizations. Situations that are rated most favorable are those having good leader-follower relations, defined tasks, and strong leader-position power. Situations that are rated least favorable have poor leader-follower relations, unstructured tasks, and weak leader-position power. Situations that are rated moderately favorable fall between these two extremes.
* Based on research findings, contingency theory posits that certain styles are effective in certain situations. People who are task motivated (low LPC score) will be effective in both very favorable and very unfavorable situations--that is, in situations that are going along very smoothly or situations that are out of control. People who are relationship motivated (high LPC score) are effective in moderately favorable situations--that is, in situations in which there is some degree of certainty but things are neither completely under their control nor completely out of their control.
* It is not entirely clear why leaders with high LPC scores are effective in moderately favorable situations or why leaders with low LPC scores are effective in both very favorable and very unfavorable situations. Fiedler's interpretation of the theory adds a degree of clarity to this issue. he provides the following line of reasoning for why leaders who are working in the "wrong" (i.e., mismatched) situation are ineffective:

* a) A leader whose LPC style does not match a particular situation experiences stress and anxiety;
* b) under stress, the leader reverts to less mature ways of coping that were learned in early development; and
* c) the leader's less mature coping style results in poor decision making which results in negative work outcomes.

* Although various interpretations of contingency theory can be made, researchers are still unclear regarding the inner workings of the theory.

## HOW DOES CONTINGENCY THEORY WORK?
* By measuring a leader's LPC score and the three situational variables, one can predict whether the leader is going to be effective in a particular setting. The relationship between a leader's style and various types of situations is illustrated in Figure 6.1. The figure is best understood by interpreting the rows from top to bottom. For example, a situation that has good leader-member relations, a structured task, and strong position power would fall in Category 1 or preferred leadership style. Alternatively, a situation that has poor leader-member relations, a structured task, and weak position power would fall in Category 6 of leadership style. By assessing the three situational variables, one can place any organizational context in one of the eight categories represented in Figure 6.1.
* Once the nature of the situation is determined, the fit between the leader's style and the situation can be evaluated. The figure indicates the low LPC's (low LPC score) are effective in Categories 1,2,3, and 8, whereas high LPCs (high LPC score) are effective in Categories 4,5,6,and 7. Middle LPCs are effective in Category 1, 2, and 3. If a leader's style matches the appropriate category in the model, that leader will be effective; if a leader's style does not match the category, that leader will be effective.
* It is important to point out that contingency theory stresses that leaders are not effective in all situations. If your style is a good match for the situation in which you work, you will succeed at your job. If your style does not match the situation, you probably will fail.

## STRENGTHS
* Contingency theory has several major strengths. First, it is supported by a great deal of empirical research. In an era in which print and electronic media abound with accounts of "how to be a successful leader", contingency theory offers an approach to leadership that has a long tradition. Many researchers have tested it and found it to a valid reliable approach to explaining how effective leadership can be achieved. Contingency theory is grounded in research.
* Second, contingency theory has broadened our understanding of leadership by forcing us to consider the impact of situations on leaders. Before contingency theory was developed, leadership theories focused on whether there was a single, best type of leadership (e.g., trait approach). However, contingency theory emphasized the importance of focusing on the relationship between the leader's style and the demands of various situations. In essence, contingency theory shifted the emphass to leadership contexts, particularly the link between the leader and the situations.
* Third, contingency theory is predictive and therefore provides useful information about the type of leadership that is most likely to be effective in certain contexts. From the data provided by the LPC scale and the descriptions of three aspects of a situation (i.e., leader-member relations, task structure, and position power), it is possible to determine the probability of success for a given person in a given situation. This gives contingency theory power that other leadership theories do not have.
* Fourth, this theory does not require that people be effective in all siutations. So often leaders in organizations feel the need to be all thigns to all people, which may be asking too much of them. Contingency theory argues that leaders should not expect to be able to lead in every situation. Companies should try to place leaders in optimal situations, in situations that are ideal for their leadership style. When it is obvious that leaders are in the wrong siutation, efforts should be made to change the work variables or move the leader to another context. Contingency theory matches the leader and the situation, but does not demand that the leader fit every situation.
* Fifth, contingency theory provides data on leaders' styles that could be useful to organizations in developing leadership profiles. The LPC score one piece of information that could be used, along with other assessments in human resource planning, to develop profiles or individuals to determine how and where they would best serve an organization.

## CRITICISMS
* Although many studies support the validity of contingency theory, it has also received much criticism in the research literature. A brief discussion of these criticisms will help to clarify the overall value of contingency theory as a leadership theory.
* First, contingency theory has been criticized because it fails to explain fully why people with certain leadership styles are more effective in some situations than in others. Fiedler called this a "black box problem" because a level of mystery remains about why task-motivated leaders are good in extreme settings and relationship-motivated leaders are good in moderately favorable settings.
* The answer provided by the theory for why leaders with low LPC scores are effective in extremes is that these people feel more certain in contexts where they have a lot of control and are comfortable strongly exerting themselves. On the other hand, high LPCs are not effetiev in extreme situations because when they have a lot of control, they tend to overreact; when they have little control, they tend to focus so much on relationships that they fail to do the task. In moderate situations, high LPC are effective because they are allowed to focus on relationship issues, whereas low LPCs feel frustrated because of the lack of certainty. Because critics find these explanations somewhat inadequate, contingency theory is often challenged.
* A second major criticism of this theory concerns the LPC scale. The LPC scale has been questioned because it does not seem valid on the surface, it does not correlate well with other standard leadership measures, and it is not easy to complete correctly.
* The LPC scale measures a person' leadership style by asking the person to characterize another person's behavior. Because projection is involved in the measure, it is difficult for respondents to understand how their descriptions of another person on the scale reflect their own leadership style. It does not make sense, on the surface, to measure your style through your evaluations of another person's style.
* Although it may not be adequate for many people, the answer to this criticism is that the LPC scale is a measure of a person's motivational hierarchy. Those who are highly task motivated see their least preferred coworker in a very negative light because that person gets in the way of their own accomplishment of a task. The primary need for these people is to get the job done, and only their second needs shift toward people issues. On the other hand, those who are relationship motivated see their least preferred coworker in terms that are more positive because their primary need is to get long with people, and only their secondary needs revolve around tasks. **In short, LPC scale measures a respondent's style by assessing the degree to which the respondent sees another person getting in the way of his or her own goal accomplishment.**
* Although it takes only a few minutes to complete, the instructions on the LPC scale are not clear; they do not fully explain how the respondent is to select his or her least preferred coworker. Some respondents may get confused between a person who is their least liked coworker and one who is their least preferred coworker. Because their final LPC score is based on whom they choose as a least preferred coworker, the lack of clear directions on whom to choose as a least preferred coworker makes the LPC measure problematic.
* Although Fiedler and his colleagues have research to back up the test--retest reliability of the LPC scale, the scale remains suspect for many practitioners because it lacks face validity. Another criticism of contingentcy theory is that it is cumbersome to use in real-world settings. **It is cumbersome because it entails assessing the leader's style and three complex situational variables (leader-member relations, task structure, and position power), each of which requires a different instrument. Administering a battery of questionnaires in ongoing organizations can be difficult because it breaks up the normal flow of organizational communication and operations.
* A final criticism of contingency theory is that it fails to explain adequately what organizations should do when there is a mismatch between the leader and the situation in the workplace. Because it is a personality theory, contingency theory does not advocate teaching leaders how to adapt their style to various situations as a means to improve leadership in an organization. Rather, this approach advocates that leaders engage in situational engineering, which means, in essence, changing situations to fit the leader. Although Fiedler and his colleagues argue that most situations can be changed in one respect or another to fit the leader's style, the prescriptions for how one engages in situational engineering are not clearly set forth in the theory.
* In fact, situations are not always easily changed to match the leader's style. For example, if a leader's style does not match an unstructured, low-power situation, it may be impossible to make the task more structured and increase the position power to fit the leader's style. Similarly, progression up the management ladder in organizations may mean that a leader moves into a new situation in which her or his style does not fit. For example, a manager with a high LPC (relationship-motivated) score might receive a promotion that places her in a context that has good leader-member relations, task structure, and position power, thus rendering her ineffective according to contingency theory. Certainly, it would be questionable for a company to change the situation, which otherwise would be considered nearly ideal in most ways. Overall, changing the situation can result in positive outcomes, but this does present significant workability problems for organizations.

## APPLICATION
* Contingency theory has many applications in the organizational world: It can be used to answer a host of questions about the leadership of individuals in various types of organizations. For example, it can be used to explain why a person is ineffective in a particular position even though the person is a conscientious, loyal, and hardworking manager. In addition, the theory can be used to predict whether a person who has worked well in one position in an organization will be equally effective if moved into a quite different  position in the same company. Furthermore, contingency theory can point to changes that upper management might like to make in a lower-level position in order to guarantee a good fit between an existing manager and a particular work context. These are just a few of the ways in which this theory could be applied in organizational settings.

## CASE STUDIES
* The following three case studies provide leadership situations that can be analyzed and evaluted from the perspective of contingency theory. As you read the cases, try to diagnose them using the principles of contingency theory. It will be helpful to try to categorize each case using information provided in Figure 6.1. At the end of each case, a series of questions will help you analyze the case.

#### CASE 6.1: No Control Over the Student Council
* Tamara Popovich has been elected president of the student council at the local college she attends. She likes the other council members, and they seem to like her. Her first job as president of the council is to develop a new policy for student computer fees. This is the first year that computer fees are being assessed, so there are no specific guidelines for what should be included in this policy. Because the council members are elected by the student body, Tamara has no control over how they work, and has no way of rewarding or punishing them. In a leadership course Tamar took, she filled out the LPC questionnaire, and her score was 98.

Questions
1. How will Tamara do as president of the student council?
2. According to her LPC score, what are her primary needs?
3. How will these needs affect her ability to develop the new policy for computer fees?
4. How can Tamara change the situation to match her management style?

#### CASE 6.2: Giving Him a Hard Time
* Bill Smith has been the high school band teacher for 15 years. Every year, he is in charge of planning and conducting a different type of concert for the holidays. This year, his plan is to present a special jazz program in conjunction with the senior choir. For some reason, the band and choir members have it for Bill and are constantly giving him trouble. Band and choir are extracurricular activities in which students volunteer to participate. While taking a management class at a local university, Bill took the LPC scale and his score was 44.

Questions
1. According to Figure 6.1, what category does this situation fall into?
2. Will Bill be successful in his efforts to run the holiday program?
3. Should the school administration make any changes regarding Bill's position?

#### CASE 6.3: What's the Best Leader Match?
* Universal Drugs is a family-owned pharmaceutical company that manufactures generic drugs such as aspirin and vitamin pills. The owners of the company have expressed a strong interst in making the management of the company, which traditionally has been very authoritarian, more teamwork oriented.
* To design and implement the new management structure, the owners have decided to create a new position. The person in this position would report directly to the owners and have complete freedom to conduct performance reviews of all managers directly involved in the new system. Two employees from within the company have applied for the new position.
* Martha Lee has been with Universal for 15 years and has been voted by her peers "most outstanding manager" on three different occasions. She is friendly, honest, and extremely conscientious about reaching short-term and long term goals. When given the LPC scale by the personnel department. Martha received a score of 52.
* Bill Washington came to Universal 5 years ago with an advanced degree in organizational development. He is director of training where all of his subordinates say he is the most caring manager they have ever had. While at Universal, Bill has built a reputation for being a real people person. Reflecting his reputation is his score on the LPC scale, an 89.

Questions
1. According to contingency theory, which of the two applicants should the new owner choose to head the new management structure? Why?
2. Could the owner define the new position according to contingency theory in such a way that it would qualify one of the applicants more than the other?
3. Will Universal Drugs benefit by using contingency theory in its decision making regarding its new management structure?

## LEADERSHIP INSTRUMENT
* The LPC scale is used in contingency theory to measure a person's leadership style. For example, it measures your style by having you describe a coworker with whom you have difficulty completing a job. This need not be a coworker you disliked a great deal but rather someone with whom you least like to work. After you have selected this person, the LPC strument asks you to describe your coworker on 18 sets of adjectives.
* Low LPC are task motivated. Their primary needs are to accomplish tasks, and their secondary needs are focused on getting along with people. In a work setting, they are concerned with achieving success on assigned tasks, even at the cost of poor interpersonal relationships with coworkers. Low LPCs gain self-esteem by achieving their goals. They may attend to interpersonal relationships, but only after they first have directed themselves toward the tasks of the group.
* Middle LPCs are socioindependent. In the context of work, they are self-directed and not overly concerned with the task or with how others view them. They are more reoved from the situation and act more independently than low or high LPCs.
* High LPCs are motivated by relationships. These people derive their major satisfaction in an organization from interpersonal relationships. A high LPC sees positive qualities even in the coworker she or he least prefers, and even if the high LPC does not work well with that person. In an organizational setting, the high LPC attends to tasks, but only after she or he is certain that the relationship between people are in good shape

# Chapter 7: Path-Goal Theory

## DESCRIPTION
* Path-goal theory is about how leaders motivate subordinates to accomplish designated goals. Drawing heavily from research on what motivates employees, path-goal theory first appeared in the leadership literature in the early 1970s in the work of Evans, House, House and Dessler, and House and Mitchel. The stated goal of this leadership theortyt is to enhance employee performance and employee satisfaction by focusing on employee motivation.
* In contrast to the situational approach, which suggests that a leader must adapt to the development level of subordinates, and unlike contingency theory, which emphasizes the match between the leader's style and specific situational variables, path-goal theory emphasizes the relationship between the leader's style and the characteristics of the subordinates and the work setting. **The underlying assumption of path-goal theory is derived from expectancy theory, which suggests that subordinates will be motivated if they think they are capable of performing their work, if they believe their efforts will result in a certain outcome, and if they believe that the payoffs for doing their work are worthwhile.**
* For the leader, the challenge is to use a leadership style that best meets subordinates' motivational needs. This is done by choosing behaviors that complement or supplement what is missing in the work setting. Leaders try to enhance subordinates' goal attainment by providing information or rewards in the work environment; leaders provide subordinates with the elements they think subordinates need to reach their goals.
* According to House and Mitchel, leadership generates motivation when it increases the number and kinds of payoffs that subordinates receive from their work. Leadership also motivates **when it makes the path to the goal clear and easy to travel through coaching and direction, removing obstacles and roadblocks to attaining the goal, and making the work itself more personally satisfying**.
* In brief, path-goal theory is designed to explain how leaders can help subordinates along the path to their goals by selecting specific behaviors that are best suited to subordinates' needs and to the situation in which subordinates are working. By choosing the appropriate style, leaders increase subordinates' expectations for success and satisfaction.
* Figure 7.2 illustrates the different components of path-goal theory, including **leader behaviors, subordinate characteristics, task characteristics, and motivation**. Path-goal theory suggests that each type of leader behavior has a different kind of impact on suborindates' motivation. Whether a particular leader behavior is motivating to subordinates is contingent on the subordinates' characteristics and the characteristics of the task.

#### Leader Behaviors
* Although many different leadership behaviors could have been selected to be a part of path-goal theory, this approach has so far examined directive, supportive, participative, and achievement-oriented leadership behaviors. Path-goal theory is explicitly left open to the inclusion of other variables.

#### Directive Leadership
* Directive leadership is similar to the "initiating structure" concept described in the Ohio State studies and the "telling" style described in situational leadership. It characterizes a leader who gives subordinates instructions about their task, including what is expected of them, how it is to be done, and the time line for when it should be completed. A directive leader sets clear standard of performance and makes the rules and regulations clear to subordinates.

#### Supportive Leadership
* Supportive leadership resembles the consideration behavior construct that was identified by the Ohio State studies discussed in Chapter 4. Supportive leadership consists of being friendly and approachable as a leader and includes attending to the well-being and human needs of subordinates. Leaders using supportive behaviors go out of their way to make work pleasant for subordinates. In addition, supportive leaders treat subordinates as equals and give them respect for their status.

#### Participative Leadership
* Participative leadership consists of inviting subordinate to share in the decision making. A participative leader consults with subordinates, obtain their ideas opinions, and integrates their suggestions into the decisions about how the group or organization will proceed.

#### Achievement-Oriented Leadership
* Achievement-oriented leadership is characterized by a leader who challenges subordinates to perform work at the highest level possible. This leader establishes a high standard of excellence for suborindates and seeks continuous improvement. In addition to expecting a lot from subordinates, achievement-oriented leaders show a high degree of confidence that subordinates are capable of establishing and accomplishing challenging goals.

===

* House and Mitchel suggested that leaders might exhibit any of all of these four styles with various subordinates and in different situations. Path-goal theory is not a trait approach that locks leaders into only one kind of leadership. Leaders should adapt their styles to the situation or to the motivational needs of their subordinates. For example, if subordinates need participative leadership at one point in a task and directive leadership at another, the leader can change her or his style as needed. Different situations may call for different types of leadership behavior. Furthermore, there may be instances when it is appropriate for a leader to use more than one style at the same time.
* In addition to leader behavior, Figure 7.2 illustrates two other major components of path-goal theory: subordinate characteristics and task characteristics. Each of these two sets of characteristics influences the way leaders' behaviors affect subordinate motivation. In other words, the impact of leadership is contingent on the characteristics of both subordinates and their task.

#### Subordinate Characteristics
* Subordinate characteristics determine how a leader's behavior is interpreted by subordinates in a given work context. Researchers have focused on subordinates' needs for affiliation, preferences for structure, desires for control, and self-perceived level of task ability. These characteristics and many others determine the degree to which subordinates find the behavior of a leader an immediate source of satisfaction or instrumental to some future satisfaction.
* Path-goal theory predicts that subordinates who have strong need for affiliation prefer supportive leadership because friendly and concerned leadership is a source of satisfaction. For subordinates who are dogmatic and authoritarian and have to work in uncertain situations, path-goal theory suggests directive leadership because that provides psychological structure and task clarity. Directive leadership helps these subordinates by clarifying the path to the goal, making it less ambiguous. The authoritarian type of subordinate feel more comfortable when the leader provides a greater sense of certainty in the work setting.
* Subordinates' desires for control have received special attention in path-goal research through studies of a personality construct locus of control that can be subdivided into internal and external dimensions. Subordinates with an internal focus of control believe that they are in charge of the events that occur in their life, whereas those with an external locus of control believe that chance, fate, or outside forces determine life events. Path-goal theory suggests that for subordinates with an internal locus of control participative leadership is most satisfying because it allows them to feel in charge of their work and to be an integral part of decision making. For subordinates with an external locus of control, path-goal theory suggests that directive leadership is best because it parallels subordinates' feelings that outside forces control their circumstances.
* Another way in which leadership affects subordinates' motivation is the subordinates' perception of their own ability to perform a specific task. As subordinates' perception of their own abilities and competence goes up, the need for directive leadership goes down. In effect, directive leadership becomes redundant and perhaps excessively controlling when subordinates feel competent to complete their own work.

#### Task Characteristics
* In addition to subordinate characteristics, task characteristics also have a major impact on the way a leader's behavior influences subordinates' motivatoin. Task characteristics include the design of the subordinate's task, the formal authority system of the organization, and the primary work group of subordinates. Collectively, these characteristics in themselves can provide motivation for subordinates. When a situation provides a clearly structured task, strong group norms, and an established authority system, subordinates will find the paths to desired goals apparent and will not need a leader to clarify goals or coach them in how to reach these goals. Subordinates will feel as if they can accomplish their work and that their work is of value. Leadership in these types of contexts could be seen as unnecessary, unempathetic, and excessively controlling.
* In some situations, however, the task characteristics may call for leadership involvement. **Tasks that are unclear and ambiguous call for leadership input that provides structure. In addition, highly repetitive tasks call for leadership that gives support in order to maintain subordinates' motivation.** In work setting where the formal authority system is weak, leadership becomes a tool that helps subordinates by making the rules and work requirements clear. In context where the group norms are weak or nonsupportive, leadership assists in building cohesiveness and role responsibility.
* A special focus of path-goal theory is helping subordinates overcome obstacles. Obstacles could be just about anything in the work setting that gets in the way of subordinates. Specially, obstacles create excessive uncertainties, frustrations, or threats for subordinates. In these settings, path-goal theory suggests that it is the leader's responsibility to help subordinates by removing these obstacles or helping them around them. Helping subordinates around these obstacles will increase subordinates' expectations that they can complete the task and increase their sense of job satisfaction.
* In 1996, House published a reformulated path-goal theory that extends his original work to include eight classes of leadership behaviors. Besides the four leadership behaviors discussed previously in this chapter-- a) directive, b) supportive, c) participative, and d) achievement-oriented behavior-- the new theory adds e) work facilitation, f) group-oriented decision process, g) work-group representation and networking, and h) value-based leadership behavior. The essence of the new theory in the same as the original : To be effective, leaders need to help subordinates by giving them what is missing in their environment and by helping them compensate for deficiencies in their abilities.

## HOW DOES PATH-GOAL THEORY WORK?
* Path-goal theory is an approach to leadership that is not only theoretically complex, but also pragmatic. In theory, it provides a set of assumption about how various leadership styles interact with characteristics of subordinates and the work setting to affect the motivation of subordinates. In practice, the theory provides direction about how leaders can help subordinates to accomplish their work in a satisfactory manner. Table 7.1 illustrates how leadership behaviors are related to subordinate and task characteristics in path-goal theory.
* Theoretically, the path-goal approach suggests that leaders need to choose a leadership style that best fits the needs of subordinates and the work they are doing. The theory predicts that a directive style of leadership is best in situations in which subordinates are dogmatic and authoritarian, the task demands are ambiguous, the organizational rules are unclear, and the task is complex. In these situations, directive leadership complements the work by providing guidance and psychological structure for subordinates.
* For tasks that are structured, unsatisfying, or frsutrating, path-goal theory suggests that leaders should use a supportive style. The supportive style provides what is missing by nurturing subordinates when they are engaged in tasks that are repetitive and unchallenging. Supportive leadership offers a sense of human touch for subordinates engaged in mundane, mechanized activity.
* Participative leadership is considered best when a task is ambiguous. Participation gives greater clarity to how certain paths lead to certain goals, and helps subordinates learn what leads to what. In addition, participative leadership has a positive impact when subordinates are autonomous and have a strong need for control because this kind of subordinate respond favorably to being involved in decision making and in the structure of work.
* Furthermore, path-goal theory predicts that achievement-oriented leadership is most effective in settings in which subordinates are required to perform ambiguous tasks. In settings such as these, leaders who challenge and set high standards for subordinates raise subordinates' confidence that they have the ability to reach these goals. In effect, achievement-oriented leadership helps subordinates feel that their efforts will result in effective performance. In settings where the task is more structured and less ambiguous, however, achievement-oriented leadership appears to be unrelated to subordinates' expectations about their work efforts.
* Pragmatically, path-goal theory is straightforward. An effective leader has to attend to the needs of subordindates. The leader should help subordinates to define the goals and the paths they want to take in reaching those goals. When obstacles arise, the leader needs to help subordinates confront them. This may mean helping the subordinate around the obstacle, or it may mean removing the obstacle. The leader's job is to help subordinates reach their goals by directing, guiding, and coaching them along the way.

## STRENGTHS
* Path-goal theory has several positive features. First, path-goal theory provids a useful theoretical framework for understanding how various leadership behaviors affect subordinates' satisfaction and work performance. It was one of the first theories to specify four conceptually distinct varieties of leadership (e.g., directive, supportive, participative, and achievement-oriented), expanding the focus of prior research, which dealt exclusively with task- and relationship-oriented behaviors. The path-goal approach was also one of the first situational contingency theories of leadership to explain how task and subordinate characteristics affect the impact of leadership on subordinate performance. The framework provided in path-goal theory informs leaders about how to choose an appropriate leadership style based on the various demands of the task and the type of subordinates being asked to do the task.
* A second positive feature of path-goal theory is that it attemptse to integrate the motivation principles of expectancy theory into the theory of leadership. This makes path-goal theory unique because no other leadership approach deals directly with motivation in this way. Path-goal theory forces us continually to ask questions such as these about subordinate motivation: How can I motivate subordinates to feel that they have the ability to do the work? How can I help them feel that if they successfully do their work, they will be rewarded? What can I do to improve the payoffs that suborindates expect from their work? Path-goal theory is designed to keep these kinds of questions, which address issues of motivation, at the forefront of the leader's mind.
* A third strength, and perhaps its greatest, is that path-goal theory provides a model that in certain ways is very practical. The representation of the model underscores and highlights the important ways leaders help subordinates. it shouts out for leaders to clarify the path to the goals and remove or help subordinates around the obstacles to the goals. In its simplest form, the theory reminds leaders that the overarching purpose of leadership is to guide and coach subordinates as they move along the path to achieve a goal.

## CRITICISMS
* Although path-goal thoery has various strengths, it also has several identifiable weakness. First, path-goal theory is so complex and incporates so many different aspects of leadership that interpreting the theory can be confusing. For example, path-goal theory makes prediction about which of four different leadership styles is appropriate for tasks with different degrees of structure, for goals with different levels of clarity, for workers at different levels of ability, and for organization with different degrees of formal authority. To say the least, it is a daunting task to incorporate all of these factors simultaneously into one's selection of a preferred leadership style. Because the scope of path-goal theory is so broad and encompasses so many different interrelated sets of assumptions, it is different to use this theory fully in trying to improve the leadership process in a given organizational context.
* A second limitation of path-goal theory is that it has received only partial support from the many empirical research studies that have been conducted to test its validity. For example, some research supports the prediction that leader directiveness is positively related to worker satisfaction when tasks are ambiguous, but other research has failed to confirm this relationship. Furthermore, not all aspects of the thoery have been given equal attention. A great deal of research has been designed to study directive and supportive leadership, but fewer studies address participative and achievement-oriented leadership. The claims of path-goal thoery remain tentative because the research findings to date do not provide a full and consistent picture of the basic assumptions and corollalries of path-goal theory.
* Another criticism of path-goal theory is that it fails to explain adequately the relationship between leadership behavior and worker motivation. path-goal theory is unique in that it incorporates the tenets of expectancy theory; however, it does not go far enough in explicating how leadership is related to these tenets. The principles of extectancy theory suggest that subordinates will be motivated if they feel competent and trust that their efforts will get results, but path-goal theory does not describe how a leader could use various style directly to help subordinates feel competent or asured of success. For example, path-goal theory does not explain how directive leadership during ambiguous tasks increases subordinate motivaton. Similarly, it does not explain how supportive leadership during tedious work related to subordinate motivation. The result is that the practitioner is left with an inadequate understanding of how her of his leadership will affect subordinates' expectations about their work.
* A final criticism that can be made of path-goal theory concerns a practical outcome of the theory. Path-goal theory suggests that it is important for leaders to help subordinates define and clarify goals, and to help subordinates around obstacles as they attempt to reach their goals. In effect, this approach treats leadership as a one-way event: The leader affects the subordinate. The potential difficulty in this type of "helping" leadership is that subordinates may easily become dependent on the leader to accomplish their work. Path-goal theory places a great deal of responsibility on leaders and much less on suborindates. Over time, this kind of leadership could be counterproductive because it promotes dependency and fails to recognize the full abilities of subordinates.

## APPLICATIONS
* Path-goal theory is not an approach to leadership for which many management training programs have been developed. You will not find many seminars with titles such as "Improving Your Path-Goal Leadership" or "Assessing Your Skills in Path-Goal Leadership" either. Nevertheless, path-goal theory does offer significant insights that can be applied in ongoing settings to improve one's leadership.
* Path-goal theory provides a set of general recommendations based on the characteristics of subordinates and tasks for how leaders should act in various situations if they want to be effective. It informs us about when to be directive, supportive, participative, or achievement-oriented. **For instance, the thoery suggests that leadres should be directive when tasks are complex, and the leader should give support when tasks are dull.** Similarly, it suggests that leaders should be participative when subordinates need control and that leaders should be achievement oriented when subordinates need to excel. In a general way, path-goal theory offers leaders a road map that gives directions about ways to improve subordinate satisfaction and performance.
* The principles of path-goal theory can be used by leaders at all levels in the organization and for all types of tasks. To apply path-goal theory, a leader must carefully assess the subordinates and their tasks, and then choose an appropriate leadership style to match those characteristics. If subordinates are feeling insecure about doing a task, the leader needs to adopt a style that builds subordinate confidence. For example, in a university setting where a junior faculty member feels apprehensive about his or her teaching and research, a department chair should give supportive leadership. By giving care and support, the chair helps the junior faculty member gain a sense of confidence about his or her ability to perform the work. If subordinates are uncertain whether their efforts will result in reaching their goals, the leader need to prove to them that their efforts will be rewarded. As discussed earlier in the chapter, path-goal theory is is useful because it contingually reminds leaders tht their central purpose is to help subordinates define their goals and then to help subordinates reach their goals in the most efficient manner.

## CASE STUDIES
* The following cases provide descriptions of various situations in which a leader is attempting to apply path-goal theory. Two of the cases, Case 7.1 and 7.2, are from traditional business contexts; the third, Case 7.3, is from an informal social organization. As you read the cases, try to apply the principles of path-goal theory to determine the degree to which you think the leaders in the case have done a good job of using this theory.

## CASE 7.1: Three Shifts, Three Supervisors
* Brako is a small manufacturing company that produces parts for the automobile industry. The company has several patents on parts that fit in the brake assembly of nearly all domestic and foreign cars. Each year, the company producers 3 million parts that it ships to assembly plants throughout the world. To produce the parts, Brako runs three shifts with about 40 workers on each shift.
* The supervisors for the three shifts (Arts, Bob, and Carol) are experienced employees, and each has been with the company for more than 20 years. The supervisors appear satisfied with their work and have reported no major difficulty in supervising employees at Brako.
* Art supervises the first shift. Employees describe him as being a very hand-on type of leader. He gets very involved in the day-to-day operations of the facility. Workers joke that Art knows to the milligram the amount of raw materials the company has on hand at any given time. Art often can be found walking through the plant and reminding people of the correct procedures to follow in doing their work. Even for those working on the production line, Art always has some directions and reminders.
* Workers on the first shift have few negative comments to make about Art's leadership. However, they are negative about many other aspects of their work. Most of the work on this shift is very straightforward and repetitive; as a result, it is monotonous. The rules for working on the production line or in the packaging area are all clearly spelled out and require no independent decision making on the part of workers. Workers simply need to show up and go through the motions. On lunch breaks, workers often are heard complaining about how bored they are doing the same old thing over and over. Workers do not criticize Art, but they do not think he really understands the situation.
* Bob supervises the second shift. He really enjoys working at Brako and wants all the workers on the afternoon shift to enjoy their work as well. Bob is a people-oriented supervisor whom workers describe as very genuine and caring. Hardly a day goes by that Bob does not post a message about someone's birthday or someone's personal accomplishment. Bob works hard at creating camaraderie, including sponsoring a company softball team, taking people out to lunch, and having people over to his house for social events.
* Despite Bob's personableness, absenteeism and turnover are highest on the second shift. The second shift is responsible for setting up the machines and equipment when changes are made from making one part to making another. In addition, the second shift is responsible for the complex computer programs that monitor the machines. Workers on the second shift take a lot of heat from others at Brako for not doing a good job.
* Workers on the second shift feel pressure because it is not always easy to figure out how to do their tasks. Each setup is different and entails different procedures. Although the computer is extremely helpful when it is calibrated appropriately to the task, it can be extremely problematic when the software it uses is off the mark. Workers have complained to Bob and upper management many times about the difficulty of their jobs.
* Carol supervises the third shift. Her style is different from that of the others at Brako. Carol routinely has meetings, which she labels troubleshooting sessions, for the purpose of identifying problems workers are experiencing. Any time there is glitch on the production line, Carol wants to know about it so she can help workers find a solution. If workers can not do a particular job, she shows them how. For those who are uncertain of their competencies, Carol gives reassurance. Carol tries to spend time with each worker and help the workers focus on their personal goals. In addition, the stresses company goals and the rewards that are available if workers are able to make the grade.
* People on the thid shift like to work for Carol. They find she is good at helping them do their job. They say she has a wonderful knack for making everything fall into place. When there are problems, she addresses them. When workers feel down, she builds them up. Carol was described by one worker as an interesting mixture of part parent, part coach, and part manufacturing expert. Upper management at Brako is pleased with Carol's leadership, but they have experienced problems repeatedly when workers from Carol's shift have been rotated to other shifts at Brako.

Questions
1. Based on the principles of path-goal theory, describe why Art and Bob appear to be less effective than Carol.
2. How does the leadership of each of the three supervisors affect the motivation of their respective subordinates?
3. If you were consultuing with Brako about leadership, what changes and recommendations would you make regarding the supervision of Art, Bob, and Carol?


## CASE 7.2: Direction for Some, Support for Others
* Daniel Shivitz is the manager of a small business called The Copy Center, which is located near a large university. The Copy Center employs about 18 people, most of whom work part-time while going to school full-time. The store caters to the university community by specializing in course packs, but it also provides desktop publishing and standard copying services. It has three large, state-of-the-art copy machines and several computer workstations.
* There are two other national chain copy stores in the immediate vincinity of The Copy Center, yet this store does more business than both of the other stores combined. A major factor contributing to the success of this store is Daniel's leadership style.
* One of the things that stand out about Daniel is the way he works with his part-time staff. Most of them are students, who have to schedule their work hours around their class schedules, and Daniel has a reputation of being really helpful with working out schedule conflicts. No conflict is too small for Daniel, who is always willing to juggle schedules to meet the needs of everyone. Students talk about how much they feel included and like the spirit at The Copy Center. It is as if Daniel makes the stores like a second family for them.
* Work at The Copy Center divides itself into two main areas: duplicating services and desktop publishing. In both areas, Daniel's leadership is effective.
* Duplicating is a straightforward operation that entails taking a customer's original and making copies of them. Because this job is tedious, Daniel goes out of his way to help the staff make it tolerable. he promotes a friendly work atmosphere by doing such things as letting the staff wear casual attire, letting them choose their own tapes for background music, and letting them be a bit wild on the job. Daniel spends a lot of time each day conversing informally with each employee; he also welcomes staff talking with each other. Daniel has a knoack for making each worker feel significant even when the work is insignificant. He promotes camaraderie among his staff, and he is not afraid to become involved in their activities.
* The desktop publishing area is more complex than duplicating. It involves creating business forms, advertising pieces, and resumes for customers. Working in desktop publishing requires skills in writing, editing, design, and layout. It is challenging work because it is not always easy to satisfy customers' needs. Most of the employees in this area are full-time workers.
* Thorugh the years, Daniel has found that employees who work best in desktop publishing are a unique type of person, very different from those who work in duplicating. They are usually quite independent, self-assured, and self-motivated. In supervising them, Daniel gives them a lot of space, is available when they need help, but otherwise leaves them alone.
* Daniel likes the role of being the resource person for these employees. For example, if an employee is having difficulty on a customer's project, he willingly joins the employee in troubleshooting the problem. Similarly, if one of the staff is having problems with a software program, Daniel is quick to offer his technical expertise. Because the employees in desktop publishing are self-directed, Daniel spends far less time with them than with those who work in duplicating.
* Overall, Daniel feels successful with his leadership at The Copy Center. Profits for the store continue to grow each year, and its reputation for high-quality service is widespread

Questions
1. According to path-goal theory, why is Daniel an effective leader?
2. How does his leadership style affect the motivation of employees at The Copy Center?
3. How do characteristics of the task and the subordinates influence Daniel's leadership.
4. one of the principles of path-goal theory is to make the end goal valuable to workers. What could Daniel do to improve subordinate motivation in this area?

## CASE 7.3: Marathon Runners at Different Levels
* David Abruzzo is the newly elected president of the Metrocity Striders Track Club (MSTC). One of his duties is to serve as the coach for runners who hope to complete the New York City Marathon. Because David has run many marathons and ultramarathons successfully, he feels quite comfortable assuming the role and responsibilities of coach for the marathon runners.
* The training period for runners intending to run New York is 16 weeks. During the first couple of weeks of training, David was pleased with the progress of the runners and had little difficulty in his role as coach. However, when the runners reached Week 8, the halfway mark, some things began to occur that raised questions in David's mind regarding how best to help his runners. The issues of concern seemed quite different from those that David had expected to hear from runners in a marathon training program. All in all, the runners and their concerns could be divided into three different groups.
* One group of runners, most of whom had never run a marathon, peppered the coach with all kinds of questions. They were very concerned about how to do the marathon and whether they had the ability to complete such a challenging event successfully. They asked questions about how far to run in training, what to eat, how much to drink, and what kind of shoes to wear. One runner wanted to know what to eat the night before the marathon,

# CHAPTER 8: Leader-Member Exchange Theory

## DESCRIPTION
* Most of the leadership theories discussed thus far in this book have emphasized leadership from the point of view of the leader (e.g., trait approach, skills approach, and style approach) or the follower and the context (e.g., situational leadership, contingency theory, and path-goal theory). Leader-member exchange (LMX) theory takes still another approach and conceptualizes leadership as a process that is centered on the interactions between leaders and followers. As Figure 8.1. illustrates, LMX theory makes the dyadic relationship between leaders and followers the focal point of the leadership process.
* Before LMX theory, researchers treated leadership as something leaders did toward all of their followers. This assumption implied that leaders treated followers in a collective way, as a group, using an average leadership style. LMX theory challenged this assumption and directed researchers' attention to the differences that might exist between the leader and each of the leader's followers.

#### Early Studies
* In the first studies of exchange theory, which was then called vertical dyad linkage (VDL) theory, researchers focused on the nature of the vertical linkages leaders formed with each of their followers. A leader's relationship to the work unit as a whole was viewed as a series of vertical dyads. In assessing the characteristics of these vertical dyads, researchers found two general types of linkages (or relationships): those that were based on expanded and negotiated role responsibilities (extra-roles), which were called the in-group, and those that were based on the formal employment contract (defined roles), which were called the out-group.
* Within an organizational work unit, subordinates become a part of the in-group or the out-group based on how well they work with the leader and how well the leader works with them. Personality and other personal characteristics are related t othis process. In addition, membership in one group or the other is based on how subordinates involve themselves in expanding their role responsibilities with the leader. Subordinates who are interested in negotiating with the leader what they are willing to do for the group can become a part of the in-group. These negotiations involve exchanges in which subordinates do certain activities that go beyond their formal job descriptions, and the leader, in turn, does more for these subordinates. If subordinates are not interested in taking on new and different job responsibilities, they become a part of the out-group.
* Subordinates in the in-group receive more information, influence, confidence, and concern from their leaders than do out-group subordinates. In addition, they are more dependable, more highly involved, and more communicative than out-group subordinates. Whereas in-group members do extra things for the leaders and the leader does the same for them, subordinates in the out-group are less compatible with the leader and usually just come to work, do their job, and go home.

#### Later Studies
* After the first set of studies, there was a shift in the focus of LMX theory. Whereas the initial studies of this theory addressed primarily the nature of the differences between in-groups and out-groups, a subsequent line of research addressed how LMX theory was related to organizational effectiveness.
* Specifically, these studies focus on how the quality of leader-member exchanges was related to positive outcomes for leaders, followers, groups, and the organization in general.
* Researchers found that high-quality leader-member exchange produced less employee turnover, more positive performance evaluations, higher frequency of promotions, greater organizational commitment, more desirable work assignments, better job attitudes, more attention and support from the leadre, greater participation, and faster career progress over 25 years.
* Based on a review of 130 studies of LMX research conducted since 2002, Anand, Hu, Liden, and Vidyarth found that interest in studying leader-member exchange has not dimished. A large majority of these studies (70%) examined the antecedents and outcomes of leader-member exchange. The research trends show increased attention to the context surrounding LMX relationships (e.g., group dynamics), analyzing leader-member exchange from individual and group levels, and studying leader-member exchange with non-U.S. samples.
* For example, using a sample of employees in a variety of jobs in Israeli organizations, Atwater and Carmeli examined the connection betweeen employees' perceptions of leader-member exchange and their energy and creativity at work. They found that perceived high-quality leader member exchange was positively related to feelings of energy in employees, which, in turn, was related to greater involvement in creative work. LMX theory was not directly associated with creativity, but it serves as a mechanism to nurture people's feelings, which then enhanced their creativity.
* Researchers have also studied how LMX theory is related to empowerment. Harris, Wheeler, and Kacmar explored how empowerment moderates the impact of leader-member exchange on job outcomes such as job satisfaction, turnover, job performance, and organizational citizenship behaviors. Based on two samples of college alumni, they found that empowerment and leader-member exchange quality had a slight synergistic effect on job outcomes. The quality of leader-member exchange mattered most for employees who felt little empowerment. For these employees, high-quality leader-member exchange appeared to compensate for the drawbacks of not being empowered.
* In essence, the aforementioned findings clearly illustrate that organizations stand to gain much from having leaders who can create good working relationships. When leaders and followers have good exchanges, they feel better and accomplish more, and the organization prospers.

#### Leadership Making
* Research of LMX theory has also begun to focus on how exchanges between leaders and subordinates can be used for leadership making. Leadership making is a prescriptive approach to leadership emphasizing that a leader should develop high-quality exchanges with all of the leader's subordinates rather than just a few. It attempts to make every subordinate feel as if he or she is a part of the in-group and, by so doing, avoids the inequities and negative implications of being in an out-group. In general, leadership making promotes partnerships in which the leader tries to build effective dyads with all employees in the work unit. In addition, leadership making suggests that leaders can create networks of partnerships throughout the organization, which will benefit the organization's goals and the leader's own career progress.
* Graen and Uhl-Bien suggested that leadership making develops progressively over time in three phases: 1) the stranger phase, 2) the acquaintance phase, 3) the mature partnership phase. (table 8.1). During Phase 1, the stranger phase, the interactions in the leader-subordinate dyad generally are rule bound, relying heavily on contractual relationships. Leaders and subordinates relate to each other within prescribed organizational roles. They have lower quality exchanges, similar to those of out-group members discussed earlier in the chapter. The subordinate complies with the formal leader, who has hierarchical status for the purpose of achieving the economic rewards the leader controls. The motives of the subordinate during the stranger phase are directed toward self-interest rather than toward the good of the group.

```

* In a study of the early stages of leader-member relationship development, Nahrang, Morgeson, and Ilies found the leaders look for followers who exhibit enthusiasm, participation, gregariousness, and extraversion. In contrast, followers look for leaders who are pleasant, trusting, cooperative, and agreeable. Leader extraversion did not influence relationship quality for the followers, and follower agreeableness did not influence relationship quality for the leaders. A key predictor of relationship quality for both leaders and followers was behaviors such as performance.
* Phase 2, the acquaintance phase, begins with an offer by the leader or the subordinate for improved career-oriented social exchanges, which involve sharing more resources and personal or work-related information. It is a testing period for both the leader and the subordinate to assess whether the subordinate is interested in taking on more roles and responsibilities and to assess whether the leader is willing to provide new challenges for subordinates. During this time, dyads shift away from interactions that are governed strictly by job descriptions and defined roles and move toward new ways of relating. As measured by LMX theory, it could be said that the quality of their exchanges has improved to medium quality. Successful dyads in the acquaintance phase begin to develop greater trust and respect for each other. They also tend to focus less on their own self-interests and more on the purposes and goals of the group.
* Phase 3, mature partnership, is marked by high-quality leader-member exchanges. People who have progressed to this stage in their relationships experience a high degree of mutual trust, respect, and obligation toward each other. They have tested their relationship and found that they can depend on each other. In mature partnership, there is a high degree of reciprocity between leaders and subordinates: Each effects and is affected by the other. For example, in a study of 75 bank managers and 58 engineering managers, Schiriesheim, Castro, Zhou, and Yammarino found that good leader-member relations were more egalitarian and that influence and control were more evenly balanced between the supervisor and the subordinate. In addition, during Phase 3, members may depend on each other for favors and special assistance. For example, leaders may rely on subordinates to do extra assignments, and subordinates may rely on leaders for needed support or encouragement. The point is that leaders and subordinate are tied together in productive ways that go well beyond a traditional hierarchically defined work relationship. They have developed an extremely effective way of relating that produces positive outcomes for themselves and the organization. In effect, partnerships are transformational in that they assist leaders and followers in moving beyond their own self-interests to accomplish the greater good on the team and organization.
* The benefits for employees who develop high-quality leader-member relationships include preferential treatment, increased job-related communication, ample access to supervisors, and increased performance-related feedback. The disadvantages for those with low-quality leader-member relationshipps include limited trust and support from supervisors and few benefits outside the employment contract. To evaluate leader-member exchanges, researchers typically use a brief questionnaire that asks leaders and followers to report on the effectiveness of their working relationships. The questionnaire assesses the degree to which respondents express respect, trust, and obligation in their exchanges with others. At the end of this chapter, a version of the LMX questionnaire is provided for you to take for the purpose of analyzing some of your own leader-member relationships.

## HOW DOES LMX THEORY WORK?
* LMX theory works in two ways: It describes leadership, and it prescribes leadership. In both instances, the central concept is the dyadic relationship that a leader forms with each of the leader's subordinates. Descriptively, LMX theory suggests that it is important to recognize the existence of in-groups and out-groups within a group or an organization.
* The differences in how goals are accomplished by in-groups and out-groups are substantial. Working with an in-group allows a leader to accomplish more work in a more effective manner than he or she can accomplish working without one. In-group members are willing to do more t han is required in their job description and look for innovative ways to advance the group's goals. In response to their extra effort and devotion, leaders give them more responsibilities and more opportunities. Leaders also give in-group members more of their time and support.
* Out-group members act quite differently than in-group members. Rather than trying to do extra work, out-group members operate strictly within their prescribed organizational roles. They do what is required of them but nothing more. Leaders treat out-group members fairly and according to the formal contract, but they do not give them special attention. For their efforts, out-group members receive the standard benefits as defined in the job description.
* Prescriptively, LMX theory is best understood within the leadership-making model of Graen and Uhl-Bien. Graen and Uhl-Bien advocated that leaders should create a special relationship with all subordinates, similar to the relationships described as in-group relationships. Leaders should offer each subordinate the opportunity to take on new roles and responsibilities. Furthermore, leaders should nurture high-quality exchanges with their subordinates. Rather than focusing on the differences bewteen in-group and out-group members, the leadership-making model suggests that leaders should look for ways to build trust and respect with all of their subordinates, thus making the entire work unit an in-group. In addition, leaders should look beyond their own work unit and create high-quality partnerships with people throughout the organization.
* whether descriptive or prescritive, LMX theory works by focusing our attention on the special, unique relationship that leaders can create with others. When these relationships are of high quality, the goals of the leader, the followers, and the organization are all advanced.

## STRENGTHS
* LMX theory makes several positive contributions to our understanding of the leadership process. First, it is a strong descriptive theory. Intuitively, it makes sense to describe work units in term of those who contribute more and those who contribute less (or the bare minimum) to the organization. Anyone who has ever worked in an organization has felt the presence of in-groups and out-groups. Despite the potential harm of out-groups, we all know that leaders have special relationships with certain people who do more and get more. We may not like this because it seems unfair, but it is a reality, and the LMX theory has accurately described this situation. LMX theory validates our experience of how people within organizations relate to each other and the leader. Some contribute more and receive more, others contribute less and get less.
* Second, LMX theory is unique because it is the only leadership approach that makes the concept of the dyadic relationship the center-piece of the leadership process. Other approaches emphasize the characteristics of leaders, followers, contexts, or a combination of these, but none of them addresses the specific relationships bewteen the leader and each subordinate. LMX theory underscores that effective leadership is contingent on effective leader-member exchanges.
* Third, LMX theory is noteworthy because it directs our attention to the importance of communication in leadership. The high-quality exchanges advocates in LMX theory are inextricable bound to effective communication. Communication, is the vehicle through which leaders and subordinates create, nurture, and sustain useful exchanges. Effective leadership occurs when the communication of leaders and subordinates is characterized by mutual trust, respect, and commitment.
* Fourth, LMX theory provides an important alert for leaders. It warns leaders to avoid letting their conscious or unconscious biases influence who is invited into the in-group (e.g., biases regarding race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or age). The principles outlined in LMX theory serve as a good reminder for leaders to be fair and equal in how they approach each of their subordinates.
* Finally, a large body of research substantiates how the practice of LMX theory is related to positive organizational outcomes. In a review of this research, Graen and Uhl-Bien pointed out that leader-member exchange is related to performance, organizational commitment, job climate, innovation, organizational citizenship behavior, empowerment, procedural and distributive justice, career progress, and many other important organizational variables. By linking the use of LMX theory to real outcomes, researchers have been able to validate the theory and increase its practice value.

## CRITICISM
* LMX theory also has some limitations. First, on the surface, leader-member exchange in its initiation formulation (vertical dyad linkage theory) runs counter to the basic human value of fairness. Throughout our lives, beginning when we are very young, we are taught to try to get along with everyone and to treat everyone equally. We have been taught that it is wrong to form in-groups or cliques because they are harmful to those who can not be a part of them. Because LMX theory divides the work unit into two groups and one group receives special attention, it gives the appearance of discrimination againt the out-group.
* Our culture is replete with examples of people of different genders, ages, cultures, and abilities who have been discriminated against. Although LMX theory was not designed to do so, it supports the development of privileged groups in the workplace. In so doing, it appears unfair and discriminatory. Furthermore, as reported by McClane, the existence of in-groups and out-groups may have undesirable effects on the group as a whole.
* Whether LMX theory actually creates inequalities is questionable. If a leader does not intentionally keep out-group members "out", and they are free to become members of the in-group, then LMX theory may not create inequalities. However, the theory does not elaborate on strategies for how one gains access to the in-group if one chooses to do so.
* Furthermore, LMX theory does not address other fairness issues, such as subordinates' perceptions of the fairness of pay increases and promotion opportunities (distributive justice), decision-making rules (procedual justice), or communication of issues within the organization (interactional justice). There is a need for further research on how these types of fairness issues affect the development and maintenance of LMX relationships.
* A second criticism of LMX theory is that the basic ideas of the theory are not fully developed. For example, the theory does not fully explain how high-quality leader-member exchanges are created. In the early studies, it was implied that they were formed when a leader found certain subordinates more compatible in regard to personality, interpersonal skills, or job competencies, but these studies never described the relative importance of these factors or how this process worked. Research has suggested that leaders should work to create high-quality exchanges with all subordinates, but the guidelines for how this is done are not clearly spelled out. For example, the model on leadership making highlights the importance of role making, incremental influence, and type of reciprocity, but it does not explain how these concepts function to build mature partnerships. Similarly, the model strongly promotes building trust, respect, and obligation in leader-subordinate relationships, but it does not describe the means by which these factors are developed in relationships.
* Based on an examination of 147 studies of leader-member exchange, Schrieshiem, Castro, and Cogliser concluded that improved theorization about leader-member exchange and its basic processes is needed. Similarly, in a review of t he research on relational leadership. Uhl-Bien, Maslyn, and Ospina point to the need for further understanding of how high and low-quality relationships develop in leader-member exchange. Although many studies have been conducted on leader-member exchange, these studies have not resulted in a clear, refined set of definitions, concepts, and propositions about the theory.
* A third criticism of the thoery is that researchers have not adequately explained the contextual factors that may have an impact on LMX relationships. Since leader-member exchange is often studied in isolation, researchers have not examined the potential impact of other variables on LMX dyads. For example, workplace norms and other organizational culture variables are likely to influence leader-member exchange. There is a need to explore how the surrounding constellations of social networks influence specific LMX relationships and the individuals in those relationships.
* Finally, questions have been raised about the measurement of leader-member exchanges in LMX theory. For example, no empirical studies have used dyadic measures to analyze the LMX process. In addition, leader-member exchanges have been measured with different versions of leader-member exchange scales and with different levels of analysis, so the results are not always directly comparable. Furthermore, the content validity and dimensionality of the scales have been questioned.

# Chapter 12: Team Leadership

## DESCRIPTION
* Leadership in organizational work teams has become one of the most popular and rapidly growing areas of leadership theory and research. A team is a specific type of group composed of members who are interdependent, who share common goals, and who must coordinate their activities to accomplish these goals. Examples of such teams include project management teams, task forces, work units, standing committees, quality teams, and improvement teams. Teams have an applied function within an organizational context. A team has specific roles for its members with requisite knowledge and skills to perform these roles.
* Reviews of the historical roots of group research provide a clear explanation of the long and diverse study of human groups. Porter and Beyerlein indiciate that the study of groups actually began in the 1920s and 1930s, with the focus of the human relations movement on collaborative efforts at work, as opposed to the individual efforts previously advocated by scientific management theorists. In the 1940s, the focus shifted to the study of group dynamics and the development of social science theory. In the 1950s, the focus moved to sensitivity training and T-groups, and the role of leadership in these groups. Much of this early research was based on laboratory studies of experimental groups, frequently ignoring the contexts in which the groups were embedded.
* In the 1960s and 1970s, the era of organizational development, researchers focused on developing team and leadership effectiveness through interventions in ongoing work teams. In the 1980s, competition from Japan and other countries encouraged the focus on quality teams, benchmarketing and continuous improvement. In the 1990s, the focus on organizational teams, while still focusing on quality shifted to a global perspective focusing on organizational strategies for maintaining a competitive advantage. Organizations have faster response capability because of their flatter organizational struture, which relies on teams and new technology to enable communication across time and space. Mankin, Cohen, and Bikson referred to this new organization as being "team-based, technology-enabled". The organizational team-based structure is an important way to remain competitive by responding quickly and adapting to constant, rapid changes.
* Much research has focused on the problems confronting organizational work teams and on ways to make them more effective. **Research on the effectiveness of organizational teams has suggested that the use of teams has led to greater productivity, a more effective use of resources, better decisions and problem solving, better-quality products and services, and greater innovation and creativity. However, for teams to be successful, the organizational culture needs to support employee involvement.** Many teams have failed because they exist in a traditional authority structure that does not promote upward communication or decision making at lower levels. Teams will have great difficulty in organizational cultures that are not supportive of collaborative work and decision making. Changing the organizational culture to one that is more support of team is possible, but it takes time and effort.
* A review of team research suggests that studies since 1996 have become more complex, focusing on more team variables, and no longer focusing exclusively on the outcome of team performance. Current research is also investigating the role of affective, behavioral, and cognitive processes in team success and viability. The role and impact of mediating processes such as trusting, bonding, planning, adapting, structuring, and learning are also being studied in terms of team performance and viability.
* It is important to focus on and understand the necessary functiosn of leadership in teams. Zaccaro, Heinen, and Shuffler urge the development of conceptual frames or models that differ from traditional leadership theory by focusing on leader-team interactions (team-centric) instead of leader-subordinate (leader-centric) interactions. Traditional leadership approaches do not explain how leaders develop their teams. "A focus on team leadership necessitates attention to the process by which teams develop critical capabilities. Contingencies that necessitate shifts in leader action are linked to task and team development dynamics that vary within teams and over time"
* Equally essential is understanding the role of leadership within teams to ensure team success and to avoid team failure. "Not surprisingly, the totality of research evidence supports this assertion, team leadership is critical to achieving both affective and behavioral based team outcomes". Other researchers have claimed that "effective leadership processes" are the most critical factor in team success. Conversely, ineffective leadership often is seen as the primary reason teams fail.
* These leadership functions can be performed by the formal team leader and/or shared by team members. Day, Groon, and Salas referred to this shared or distributed leadership as team leadership capacity, encompassing the leadership repertoire of the entire team. Distributed leadership involves the sharing of influence by team members who step forward when situations warrant providing the leadership necessary and then stepping back to allow others to lead. Such shared leadership has become more and more important in today's organizations to allow faster responses to more complex issues. Much of the early work on teams has focused on the traditional role of the formally appointed leader of the team; future research need to focus more on the distributed or shared leadership within the team. Leadership is provided by anyone who meets the needs of the team.

#### Team Leadership Model
* The team leadership model proposed in this chapter places leadership in the driver's seat of team effectiveness. The model provides a mental road map to help the leader (or any team member who is providing leadership) diagnose team problems and take appropriate action to correct these problems.
* Hill's Model for Team Leadership (Figure 12.1) **is based on the functional leadership claim that the leader's job is to monitor the team and then take whatever action is necesssary to ensure team effectiveness.** The model provides a tool for understanding the very complex phenomenon of team leadership, starting at the top with its initial leadership decisions, then moving to leader actions, and fianlly focusing on the indications of team effectiveness
