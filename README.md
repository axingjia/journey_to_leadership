Leadership: Theory and Practice

# Introduction
* Leadership is a highly sought-after and highly valued commodity. In the 15 years since the first edition of this book was published, the public has become increasingly captivated by the idea of leadership. People continue to ask themselves and others what makes good leaders. As individuals, they seek more information on how to become effective leaders. As a result, bookstore shelves are filled with popular books about leaders and advice on how to be a leader. Many people believe that leadership is a way to improve their personal, social, and professional lives. Corporations seek those with leadership ability because they believe they bring special assets to their organizations and, ultimately, improve the bottom line. Academic institutions throughout the country have responded by providing programs in leadership studies.
* In addition, leadership has gained th attention of researchers worldwide. A review of the scholarly studies on leadership shows that there is a wide variety of different theoretical approaches to explain the complexities of the leadership process. Some researchers conceptualize leadership as a trait of as a behaviour, whereas others view leadership from an information-processing perspective or relational standpoint. Leadership has been studied using both qualitative and quantitative methods in many contexts, including small groups, therapeutic groups, and large organizations. Collectively, the research findings on leadership from all of these areas provide a picture of a process that is far more sophisticated and complex than the often simplistic view presented in some of the popular books on leadership.
* This book treats leadership as a complex process having multiple dimensions. Based on the research literature, the text provides an in-depth description and application of many different approaches to leadership. Our emphasis is on how theory can inform the practice of leadership. In this book, we describe each theory and then explain how the theory can be used in real situations.

## Leadership Defined
* There are many ways to finish the sentence, "Leadership is ..." In fact, as Stogdill pointed out in a review of leadership research, there are almost as many different definitions of leadership as there are people who have tried to define it. It is much like the words democracy, love, and peace. Although each of us intuitively knows what we mean by such words, the words can have different meanings for different people. As box 1.1 shows, scholars and practioners have attempted to define leadership for more than a century without universal consensus.

Box 1.1 The Evolution of Leadership Definitions

* While many have a gut-level grasp of what leadership is, putting a definition to the term has proved to be a challenging endeavor for scholars and practioners alike. More than a century has lapsed since leadership became a topic of academic introspection, and definitions have evolved continuously during that period. These defintions have been influenced by many factors from world affairs and politics to the perspectives of the discipline in which the topic is being studied. In a seminal work, Rost analyzed materials written from 1900 to 1990, finding more than 200 different definitions for leadership. His analysis provides a succinct history of how leadership has been defined through the last century:

1990-1929
* Definition of leadership appearing in the first three decades of the 20th century emphasized control and centralization of power with a common theme of domination. For example, at a conference on leadership in 1927, leadership was defined as "the ability to impress the will of the leader on those led and induce obedience, respect, loyalty, and cooperation".

1930s
* Traits became the focus of defining leadership, with an emerging view of leadership as influence rather tahn domination. Leadership is also identified as the interaction of an individual's specific personality traits with those of a group, noting that while the attitudes and activities of the many are changed by the one, the many may also influence a leader.

1940s
* The group approach came into the forefront with leadership being defined as the behaviour of an individual while involved in directing group activities. At the same time, leadership by persuasion is distinguished from "drivership" or leadership by coercion.

1950s
* Three themes dominated leadership definitions during this decade:

        * Continuance of group theory, which framed leadership as what leaders do in groups;
        * Leadership as a relationship that develops shared goals, which defined leadership based on behaviour of the leader, and 
        * effectiveness, in which leadership is defined by the ability to influence overall group effectiveness

1960s
* Although a tumultuous time for world affairs, the 1960s saw harmony among leadership scholars. The prevailing definition of leadership as behavior that influecnes people toward shared goals was underscored by Seeman who described leadership as "act by persons which influence other persons in a shared direction"

1970s
* The group focus gave way to the organizational behavior approach, where leadership became viewd as "initiating and maintaining groups or organizations to accomplish group or organizational goals". Burn's definition, however, is the most important concept of leadership to emerge: **"Leadership is the reciprocal process of mobilizing by persons with certain motives and values, various economic, political, and other resources, in a context of competition and conflict, in order to realize goals independentlu or mutually helf by both leaders and followers".**

1980s
* This decade exploded with scholarly and popular works on the nature of leadership, brining the topic to the apex of the academic and pulic consciousnesses. As a result, the number of definition for leadership beame a prolific stew with several persevering themes:

        * Do as the leader wishes. Leadership definitions still predominantly deliver the message that leadership is getting followers to do what the leader wants done.
        * Influence. Probably the most often used word in leadership definitions of the 1980s, influence is examined from every angle. In an effort to distinguish leadership from management, however, scholars insist that leadership is noncoercive influence.
        * Traits. Spurred by the national bestseller *In Search of Excellence*, the leadership-as-excellence movement brought leaders traits back to the spotlight. As a result, many people's understanding of leadership is based on a trait orientation.
        * Transformation. Burns is credited for initiating a movement defined leadership as a transformational process, stating that leadership occurs "when one or more persons engage with others in such a way that leadrs and followers raise one another to higher levels of motivation and morality".

Into the 21st Century
* After decades of dissonance, leadership scholars agree on one thing: They can't come up with a common definition for leadership. Debate continues as to whether leadership and management are separate processes, while others emphasize the trait, skill, or relational aspects of leadership. Because of such factors as growing global influences and generational differences, leadership will continue to have different meaning for different people. The bottom line is that leadership is a complex concept for which a determined definition may long be in flux.

## Ways of Conceptualizing Leadership
* In the past 60 years, as many as 65 percent classification systems have been developed to define the dimensions of leadership. One such classification system, directly related to our discussion, is the scheme proposed by Bass. He suggested that some definitions view leadership as the focus of group processes. From this perspective, the leader is at the center of group change and activity and embodies the will of the group. Another set of definitions conceptualizes leadership from a personality perspective, which suggests that leadership is a combination of special traits or characteristics that some individuals possess. These traits enable those individuals to induce others to accomplish tasks. Other approaches to leadership define it as **an act or a behaviour--the things leaders do to bring about change in a group.**
* In addition, some define leadership in terms of the power relationship that exists between leaders and followers. From this viewpoint, leaders have power that they wield to effect change in others. Others view leadership as a transformational process that moves followers to accomplish more than is usually expected of them. Finally, some scholars address leadership from a skill perspective. This viewpoint stresses the capabilities (knowledge and skills) that make effective leadership possible.

## Definition and Components
* Despite the multitude of ways in which leadership has been conceptualized, the following components can be identified as central to the phenomenon: a) Leadership is a process, b) leadership involves influence, 3) leadership occurs in groups, and d) leadership involves common goals. Based on these components, the following definition of leadership is used in this text:

        Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal.
    
* Defining leadership as a process means that it is not a trait or characteristics that resides in the leader, but rather a transactional event that occurs between the leader and the followers. Process implies that a leader affects and is affected by followers. It emphasizes that leadership is not a linear, one-way event, but rather an interactive event. When leadership is defined in this manner, it becomes available to everyone. It is not restricted to the formally designated leader in a group.
* Leadership involves influence. It is concerned with how the leader affects followers. Influence is the sine qua non of leadership. Without influence, leadership does not exist.
*  Leadership occurs in groups. Groups are the context in which leadership takes place. Leadership involves influencing a group of individuals who have acommon purpose. This can be a small task group, a community group, or a large group encompassing an entire organization. Leadership is about one individual influencing a group of others to accomplish common goals. Others (a group) are required for leadership to occur. Leadership training programs that teach people to lead themselves are not considered a part of leadership within the definition that is set forth in this discussion.
* Leadership includes attention to common goals. Leaders direct their energies toward individuals who are trying to achieve something together. By common, we mean that the leadrs and followers have a mutual purpose. Attention to common goals gives leadership an ethical overtone because it stresses the need for leaders to work with follows to achieve selected goals. Stressing mutuality lessens the possibility that leaders might act toward followers in ways that are forced or unethical. It also increases the possibility that leaders and followers will work together toward a common goal.
* Throughout this text, the people who engage in leadership will be called leaders, and those toward whom leadership is directed will be called followers. Both leaders and followers are involved together in the leadership process. Leaders need followers, and followers need leaders. Although leaders and followers are closely linked, it is the leader who often initiates the relationship, creates the communication linkages, and carries the burden for maintaining the relationship.
* In our discussion of leaders and followers, attention will be directed toward follower issues as well as leader issues. Leaders have an ethical responsibility to attend to the needs and concerns of followers. As Burns pointed out, discussions of leadership sometimes are viewed as elitist because of the implied power and importance often ascribed to leaders in the leader-follower relationship. Leaders are not above or better than followers. Leaders and followers must be understood in relation to each other, and collectively. They are in the leadership relationship together--and are two sides of the same coin.

## LEADERSHIP DESCRIBED
* In addition to definitional issues, it is also important to discuss several other questions pertaining to the nature of leadership. In the following section, we will address questions such as how leadership as a trait differs from leadership as a process; how appointed leadership differs from emergent leadership; and how the concepts of power, coercion, and management differ from leadership.

### Trait Versus Process Leadership
* We have all heard statements such as "He is born to be a leader" or "She is a natural leader". These statements are commonly expressed by people who take a trait perspective toward leadership. The trait persepctive suggest that certain individuals have special innate or inborn characteristics or qualities that make them leaders, and that it is these qualities that differentiate them from nonleaders. Some of the personal qualities used to identify leaders include unique physical factors (e.g., height), personality features (e.g., extraversion), and other characteristics (e.g., intelligence and fluency). In chapter 2, we will discuss a large body of research that has examined these personal qualities.
* To describe leadership as a trait is quite different from describing it as a process. The trait viewpoint conceptualizes leadership as a properties possessed in varying degrees by different people. This suggests that it resides in select people and restricts leadership to those who are believed to have special, usually inborn, talents.
* The process viewpoint suggests that leadership is a phenomenon that resides in the context of the interactions between leaders and followers and makes leadership available to everyone. As a process, leadership can be observed in leadership behaviours, and can be learned. The process definition of leadership is consistent with the definition of leadership that we have set forth in this chapter.

### Assigned Versus Emergent Leadership
* Some people are leaders because of their formal position in an organization, whereas others are leaders because of the way other group members respond to them. These two common forms of leadership are called assigned leadership and emergent leadership. Leadership that is based on occupying a position in an organization is assigned leadership. Team leaders, plant managers, department heads, directors, and administrators are all examples of assigned leadership.
* Yet this person assigned to a leadership position does not always become the real leader in a particular setting. When others perceive an individual as the most influential member of a group or an organization, regardless of the individual's title, the person is exhibiting emergent leadership. The individual acquires emergent leadership through other people in the organization who support and accept that individual's behavior. This type of leadership is not assigned by position; rather, it emerges over a period through communication. Someo of the positive communication behaviors that account for successful leader emergence include being verbally involved, being informed, seeking others' opinions, initiating new ideas, and being firm but not rigid.
* In addition to communication behaviors, researchers have found that personality plays a role in leadership emergence. For example, Smith and Foti found that certain personality traits were related to leadership emergence in a sample of 160 male college students. The individuals who were more dominant, more intelligent, and more confident about their own performance (general self-efficacy) were more likely to be identified as leaders by other members of their task group. Although it is uncertain whether these findings apply to women as well, Smith and Foti suggested that these three traits could be used to identify individuals perceived to be emergent leaders.
* Leadership emergence may also be affected by gender-biased perceptions. In a study of 40 mixed-six college groups, Watson and Hoffman found that women who were urged to persuade their task groups to adopt high-quality decisions succeeded with the same frequency as men with identical instructions. Although women were equally influential leaders in their groups, they were rated significantly lower than comparable men were on leadership. Furthermore, these influential women were also rated as significantly less likable than comparably influential men were. These results suggest that there continue to be barriers to women's emergence as leaders in some settings.
* A unique perspective on leadership emergence is provided by social identity theory. From this perspective, leadership emergence is **the degree to which a person fits with the identity of the group as a whole. As groups develop over time, a group prototype also develops. Individuals emerge as leaders in the group when they become most like the group prototype. Being similar to the prototype makes leaders attractive to the group and gives them influence with the group.**
* The leadership approaches we discuss in the subsequent chapters of this book apply equally to assigned leadership and emergent leadership. When a person is engaged in leadership, that person is a leader, whether leadership was assigned or emerged. This book focuses on the leadership process that occurs when any individual is engaged in influencing other group members in their efforts to reach a common goal.

### Leadership and Power
* The concept of power is related to leadership because it is part of the influence process. Power is the capacity or potential to influence. **People have power when they have the ability to affect others' beliefs, attitudes, and courses of action.** Ministers, doctors, coaches, and teachers are all examples of people who have the potential to influence us. When they do, they are using their power, the resource they draw on to effect changein us.
* The most widely cited research on power is French and Raven's work on the bases of social power. In their work, they conceptualized power from the framework of a dyadic relationship that included both the person influencing and the person being influenced. French and Raven identified five common and important bases of power: referent, expert, legitimate, reward, and coercive. Each of these bases of power increases a leader's capacity to influence the attitudes, values, or behaviors of others.

```
Table 1.1: Five Bases of Power

* Referent Power: Based on followers' identification and liking for the leader. A teacher who is adored by students has referent power.
* Expert Power: Based on followers' perceptions of the leader's competence. A tour guide who is knowledgeable about a foreign country has expert power.
* Legitimate Power: Associated with having status or formal job authority. A judge who administers sentences in the courtroom exhibits legitimate power.
* Reward Power: Derived from having the capacity to provide reward to others. A supervisor who gives rewards to employees who work hard is using reward power.
* Coercive Power: Derived from having the capacity to penalize or punish others. A coach who sits players on the bench for being late to practice is using coercive power.
```

* In organizations, there are two major kinds of power: position power and personal power. Position power is the power a person derives from a particular office or rank in a formal organizational system. It is the influence capacity a leader derives from having higher status than the followers have. Vice presidents and department heads have more power than staff personnel do becaues of the positions they hold in the organization. Position power include legitimat,  reward, and coercive power.
* Personal power is the influence capacity a leader derives from being seen by followers as likable and knowledgeable. When leaders act in ways that are important to followers, it gives leader power. For example, some managers have power because their subordinates consider them to be good role models. Others have power because their subordinates view them as highly competent or considerate. In both cases, these managers' power is ascribed to them by others, based on how they are seen in their relationships with others. Personal power includes referent and expert power.
* In discussions of leadership, it is not unusual for leaders to be described as wielders of power, as individuals who dominate others. In these instances, power is conceptualized as a tool that leaders use to achieve their own ends. Contrary to this view of power, Burns emphasized power from a relationship standpoint. For Burns, power is not an entity that leaders use over others to achieve their own ends; instead, power occurs in relationships. It should be used by leaders and followers to promote their collective goals.
* In this text, our discussions of leadership treat power as a relational concern for both leaders and followers. We pay attention to how leaders work with followers to reach common goals.

### Leadership and Coercion.
* Coercive power is one of the specific kinds of power available to leaders. Coercion involves the use of force to effect change. To coerce means to influence others to do something against their will and may include manipulating penalities and rewards in their work environment. Coercion often involves the use of threats, punishment, and negative reward schedules. Classic examples of coercive leaders are Adolf Hitler in Germany, the Taliban leaders in Afghanistan, Jim Jones in Guyana, and North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il, each of whom has used power and restraint to force followers to engage in extreme behaviours.
* It it important to distinuish between coercion and leadership because it allows us to separate out from our examples of leadership that behaivours of individuals such as Hitler, the Taliban, and Jones. In our discussions of leadership, coercive people are not used as models of ideal leadership. Our definition suggests that leadership is reserved for those who influence a group of individuals toward a common goal. Leaders who use coercion are interested in their own goals and seldom are interested in the wants and needs of subordinates. using coercion runs counter to working with followers to achieve a common goal.

### Leadership and Management
* Leadership is a process that is similar to management in many ways. Leadership involves influence, as does management. Leadership entails working with people, which management entails as well. Leadership is concerned with effective goal accomplishment, and so is management. In general, many of the functions of management are activities that are consistent with the definition of leadership we set forth at the beginning of this chapter.
* But leadership is also different from management. Whereas the study of leadership can be traced back to Aristotle, management emerged around the turn of the 20th century with the advert of our industrialized society. Management was created as a way to reduce chaos in organizations, to make them run more effectively and efficiently. The primary functions of management, as first identified by Fayol, were planning, organizing, staffing, and controlling. These funcctions are still representative of the field of management today.
* in a book that compared the function of management with the functions of leadership, Kotter argued that the functions of the two are quite dissimilar. **The overriding function of management is to provide order and consistency to organizations, whereas the primary function of leadership is to produce change and movement.** Management is about seeking order and stability, leadership is about seeking adaptive and constructive change.

```
        Management: Produce Order and Consistency
        * Planning and Budgeting: 
            * Establish agendas
            * Set timetables
            * Allocate resources
        * Organizing and Staffing
            * Provide structure
            * Make job placements
            * Establish rules and procedures
        * Controlling and Problem Solving
            * Develop incentives
            * Generate creative solutions
            * Take corrective action

        Leadership: Produces Change and Movement
        * Establish Direction
            * Create a vision
            * Clarify big picture
            * Set strategies
        * Align People
            * Communicate goals
            * Seek commitment
            * Build teams and coalitions
        * Motivating and Inspiring
            * Inspire and energize
            * Empower subordinates
            * Satisfy unmet needs
```

* As illustrated in Figure 1.2, the major activities of management are played out differently than the activities of leadership. Although they are different in scope, Kotter contended that both management and leadership are essential if an organization is to prosper. For example, if an organization has strong management without leadership, the outcome can be stifling and bureaucratic. Conversely, if an organizationhas strong leadership without management, the outcome can be meaningless or misdirected change for change's sake. To be effective, organizations need to nourish both competent management and skilled leadership.
* Many scholars, in addition to kotter, argue that leadership and management are distinct constructs. For example, Bennis and Nanus maintained that there is a significant difference between the two. **To manage means to accomplish activities and master routines, whereas to lead means to influence othersd and create visions for change.** Bennis and Nanus made the distinction very clear in their frequent quoted sentence, "Managers are people who do things right and leaders are people who do the right thing."
* Rost has also been a proponent of distinguishing between leadership and management. He contended that leadership is a multidirectional influence relationship and management is a unidirectional authority relationship. Whereas leadership is concerned with the process of developing mutual purposes, management is directed toward coordinating activities in order to get a job done. Leaders and followers work together to create real change, whereas managers and subordinates join forces to sell goods and services
